scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - DANNY VINYARD'S EYES

speaker_heading: STACEY
dialog: Fucking pervert, Dan!
speaker_heading: DANNY
text: There's a black guy outside Der...
dialog: breaking into your car.
text: Derek, muscled and tattooed, jumps out of the bed and

speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: How long has he been out there?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Not long.
speaker_heading: STACEY

speaker_heading: DEREK

speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Not right now, honey.

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: One...I think.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Is he strapped?
speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Does he have a fucking gun, Dan?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I'm not sure.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Is there a driver?
text: Danny nods his head yes.

dialog: Derek? Be careful.
text: He looks at his girlfriend and walks off.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - SAME
text: TIGHT ON DEREK. He walks down the hall. The intensity

speaker_heading: RASMUSSEN
dialog: All right. Moving on--
dialog: (acknowledging)
dialog: Good Morning, Doctor.
text: The group looks over and meets Sweeney's hard glare.

speaker_heading: RASMUSSEN
dialog: Gentlemen, this is Dr. Bob Sweeney.
dialog: He's Principal over at Venice High and
dialog: for some time now he's done a load of
dialog: outreach work with gangs...in and out
dialog: of the can.
text: Sweeney nods as Rasmussen cough. He sips water and
dialog: continues.
speaker_heading: RASMUSSEN
dialog: Three years ago a local kid named
text: Derek Vinyard gets sent up for
text: murdering a couple of Crips who were
text: trying to jack his car. Bob taught
dialog: Vinyard back in high school and has
dialog: followed the case closely.
speaker_heading: YOUNG COP
dialog: He was a skinhead, right?
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: Derek was more like...the skinhead.
dialog: He and Cameron Alexander.
speaker_heading: COP #2
dialog: Who?
text: Rasmussen opens a FILE in front of him. There rests

speaker_heading: RASMUSSEN
dialog: Cammeron Alexander is probably the
dialog: biggest writer and distributor of
dialog: white power literature in LA County.
dialog: He promotes white power bands, writes
dialog: reviews, columns, all at the ripe age
dialog: of forty.
speaker_heading: YOUNG COP
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: He's forty? Jesus.
speaker_heading: RASMUSSEN
dialog: Pretty clean record...runs everything
text: out of his house down by the beach.
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: There weren't any organized white
dialog: gangs around Venice before those two
dialog: hooked up. Very few, if any. It was
text: mostly just black and Mexican. But it
dialog: was tiny. They hit it off though...
dialog: and Alexander hit the jackpot with
dialog: Derek.
text: Rasmussen reaches over and pushes play on a VCR.
speaker_heading: RASMUSSEN
dialog: We got some uncut footage here.
text: Courtesy of NBC.
scene_heading: ON THE TELEVISION--
speaker_heading: REPORTER

text: A YOUNGER DEREK, short haired with no tattoos, stands
text: next to the reporter. Derek wears a Venice High
text: Basketball jersey drenched in sweat. Towel around neck,
text: he thinks to himself as the man speaks into the camera.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: To my right I have Lieutenant
dialog: Vinyard's oldest son Derek.
dialog: (to Derek)
dialog: How do you feel about all this, son?
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: How do I feel? How do you think I
dialog: feel? It's typical.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: Typical how, Derek?
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Well...look at our country. It's a
dialog: haven for criminals. Black...brown...
dialog: yellow...whatever.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: So you're saying the murder of your
dialog: father is "race" related?
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Every problem in this country is
dialog: "race" related. Every problem, not
dialog: just crime. These problems are rooted
dialog: in the black community, the Hispanic
dialog: community, the Asian...every non-
dialog: Protestant group in our society.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Look at the shit. Immigration...
dialog: welfare...AIDS...they're all the
dialog: problems of the non-white. Look at
dialog: the statistics.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: Most of these issues you're referring
dialog: to though son are related to--
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: No no no! Don't say poverty right now
dialog: cause that's not it. They're not a
dialog: product of our fucking environment
dialog: either! Minorities don't give two
dialog: shits about this country! They're
dialog: here to exploit...not embrace.
speaker_heading: RASMUSSEN (O.S)
dialog: (over reporter's question)
dialog: When Alexander got his hands on this
dialog: segment...he copied it, sent it out
dialog: and it became the Gettysberg Address
dialog: for hate groups across the country.
text: BACK TO THE TELEVISION.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Millions of white Europeans came to
dialog: this country and flourished within a
dialog: generation! A generation! So what
dialog: the fuck is wrong with these people?!
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: What does any of this have to do with
dialog: your father?
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Because my father was doing his
dialog: fucking job! Saving a nigger
dialog: neighborhood he didn't give two shits
dialog: about! And he got killed by some drug
dialog: dealer who still collects a fucking
dialog: welfare check.
text: Derek looks at the man and walks over to HIS MOTHER
text: DORIS, who smokes a cigarette. The camera follows him as
text: he puts his arm around her and escorts her back inside
text: their Venice Beach residence. The camera pans back to
text: the reporter who just stands there, speechless.
scene_heading: INT. BRIEFING ROOM - SAME
text: Rasmussen ejects the tape, the screen turns to fuzz, and
text: he turns it off.
speaker_heading: RASMUSSEN
dialog: Vinyard was quietly released from
dialog: Chino on Saturday after three and some
dialog: odd years. And I think it's something
dialog: we might want to keep an eye on for a
dialog: few days.
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: I don't wanna be an alarmist. But
dialog: payback is out there. I know it is.
dialog: And in this particular case...if
dialog: Vinyard gets popped...more people will
dialog: get popped.
speaker_heading: RASMUSSEN
dialog: It's not exactly LAPD policy but I
dialog: want 24-hour surveillance on Vinyard
dialog: for a few days.
speaker_heading: COP #2
dialog: (smiling in disbelief)
dialog: Twenty-four hour surveillance, sir?
speaker_heading: RASMUSSEN
dialog: Just for a few days.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER COP
dialog: He doesn't sound like Mr. Lovely here,
dialog: Captain. You want us to bust him or
dialog: protect him?
text: Rasmussen offers Sweeney a look that it's his question.
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: I don't think Vinyard's gonna be the
dialog: one to start anything. It's his
dialog: following.
speaker_heading: RASMUSSEN
dialog: Either way...let's keep it low.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. VENICE BEACH BOARDWALK - MORNING
text: PEACEFUL DAY by PENNYWISE blasts from Danny's walkman
text: headphones. The day is cloudy and overcast but that
text: doesn't bother the local SURFERS. A twosome paddles
text: north to get a better break on the next set. Danny
text: watches as he skateboards down the strand.
text: His appearance is changed, now resembling a younger,
dialog: softer Derek.
text: Head shaved to a quarter of an inch, he wears a PLAIN
text: WHITE BACKPACK with punk/white power bands scribbled all
dialog: over it. Your standard Sex Pistols, DK, Germs, G.B.M.,

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL BATHROOM - A URINAL
text: Danny takes a piss. Outside, a voice pleads "It wasn't
text: me!" DARYL DAWSON, pale and thin, is shoved into the
text: bathroom and he trips into the sink. LITTLE HENRY, a
text: young black kid, enters with two of his buddies. Danny
text: zips up and faces them.
speaker_heading: LITTLE HENRY
dialog: (to a terrified Daryl)
dialog: Tellin' Baker I'm fuckin' cheatin'?
dialog: I've never cheated in my life.
speaker_heading: BUDDY #1
dialog: Beat his ass, Henry!
speaker_heading: LITTLE HENRY
dialog: Why you trippin' on me?
speaker_heading: DARYL
dialog: I didn't say anything, Henry. I
dialog: swear.
speaker_heading: BUDDY #2
dialog: He's lying, man! I was right there!
text: Little Henry cracks Daryl in the face and practically
text: knocks him down with one shot. A bleeding Daryl
text: struggles to his hands and knees behind Danny.
speaker_heading: LITTLE HENRY
dialog: Next time, man.
text: Danny stares into Henry's eyes and the trio exits. Dannv
text: helps Daryl back up to the sink. THE SECOND BELL RINGS.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

text: An OLDER TEACHER writes an Algebra problem on the board
dialog: for the students to solve.
speaker_heading: OLDER TEACHER

dialog: Danny.
speaker_heading: OLD TEACHER
dialog: But it looks like you got bigger
dialog: problems.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (reading the slip)
dialog: Oh, man! Come on. Get a job.
text: The teacher stares at him.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PRINCIPAL LOBBY - DANNY
text: He sits in a chair next to an office door marked DR.
scene_heading: ROBERT SWEENEY - PRINCIPAL. Danny glances at the
text: secretary as she types and talks on the phone.
text: TIGHT ON DANNY. He listens to the conversation through
text: the the crack in the door as his eyes swell.
speaker_heading: MURRAY (O.S.)
dialog: I do not have a problem with him as an
dialog: individual, alright!?
speaker_heading: SWEENEY (O.S.)
dialog: Oh shit Murray sure you do. You hate
dialog: this kid.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - THE CONVERSATION
text: The bespectacled, short-haired MURRAY ROSENBERG, 48,
text: looks over and spots Danny listening outside. Murray
text: walks over and shuts the door. He looks at DR. SWEENEY,
text: who now has his jacket off.
text: He points to a typewritten report on the desk and smiles
text: in horror. It is titled BOOK REPORT--MEIN KAMPF.
dialog: "Daniel Vinvard - American History" is in the upper left
dialog: hand corner.
speaker_heading: MURRAY
dialog: This paper is a travesty, Bob!
dialog: Arguing for Hitler as a civil rights
dialog: hero?! You've gotta draw a line.
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: Murray...it says in your syllabus that
dialog: they could do their report on any book
dialog: related to the struggle for Civil
dialog: Rights.
speaker_heading: MURRAY
dialog: Oh come on, Bob!
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: Let me finish! He needs help...I'm
dialog: not disputing that. But I read it and
dialog: I'm not going to throw him out.
speaker_heading: MURRAY
dialog: His brother probably put him up to it.
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: I can guarantee you his brother didn't
dialog: have anything to do with it, Murray.
text: Murray sighs and takes off his glasses.
speaker_heading: MURRAY
dialog: Don't let him walk scot-free here.
dialog: For his sake...not mine. You might be
text: all he has left.
text: Sweeney stares at the younger teacher and nods.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. OFFICE - THE DOOR OPENS
text: Murray walks out and turns back to Sweeney.
speaker_heading: MURRAY
dialog: Thanks, Bob.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SWEENEY (O.S.)
dialog: Okay. Get in here, Dan!
text: Danny and Murray make hostile eye contact.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I knew it was you.
speaker_heading: SWEENEY (O.S.)
dialog: Shut up and get your ass in here!
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - DANNY ENTERS
text: Before he even gets through the door he's chastised.
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: What's it gonna be, Dan?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: What's what going to be?
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: This petty shit you're pullin'.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Well...I don't know.
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: You said it, all right. Sit down.
text: Danny does what he's told. Sweeney stares at the
text: teenager and leans back in his chair.
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: Any time you wanna talk, Dan--
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: How's Derek?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Fine.
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: Adjusting okay?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: He was a student of mine. Honors
dialog: English. He was a great student...
dialog: like you...but he hung out with
dialog: scumbags. Also like you. That's why
dialog: he ended up in the pen, hunh?
text: No answer. Sweeney holds up Danny's paper.
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: Great writing. I can't correct it
dialog: though. It wreaks too much of shit.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Come on, man! I followed directions
dialog: and wrote an "A" paper. It's got
dialog: nothing to do with Derek.
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: Everything you do now has something to
dialog: do with Derek. Who told you to do
dialog: this?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Let us get on with our lives, man!
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: Hey, I'm not worried about Derek--he
dialog: can take care of himself. I'm worried
dialog: about his little brother.
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Mein Kampf, Dan? I should expel you!
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Do it. What? You don't think I could
dialog: handle it?
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: (smiling in disbelief)
dialog: The street would kill you, Danny.
dialog: You're not tough. The second a
dialog: brother pulls a gun on your ass you'll
dialog: be holierin' for Doris.
dialog: (pondering to himself)
dialog: So here's the drill. Take it or leave
dialog: it cause I'm sick of babysitting. I'm
dialog: your history teacher from here on out.
dialog: We're gonna deal with shit happening
dialog: right now. Call it American
dialog: History...X. I see your ass once a
dialog: day. Any more, any less, and you're a
dialog: memory at Venice High. Clear?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: It took me a week to read Mein Kampf.
dialog: Come on, Sweeney.
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: My name is Dr. Sweeney. And I want a
dialog: another paper on my desk tomorrow.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: What am I doing it on then?
speaker_heading: SWEENEY

speaker_heading: DANNY (V/O)
dialog: Venice Beach, man. It didn't always
dialog: look like this. I mean...our Dad used
dialog: to take us down here to run...and it

speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: You can't take a shit, Seth. Shut up.
text: Derek shoots a look to Cameron, comes to a decision, and

speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: I got a bet.
text: Lawrence stares at him, sensing something harder.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: I come in, same score now, first one
dialog: to eleven. Black boys against the

text: Lawrence looks back to his boys in disbelief.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: Name your price, Cracker.
speaker_heading: DEREK

scene_heading: EXT. COURT - BLACK VERSUS WHITE
text: No more mixed assemblage of players. One team is white,

text: A SERIES OF SMOTS
text: Derek blows by Lawrence for a left handed layup. Derek
text: hits a thirty looter. Curtis grabs a rebound and uses
text: his elbows to get defenders off him. Big Lawrence fouls
text: Derek hard and Derek stares at him. Big Lawrence makes a
text: twenty foot turnaround. Lawrence advances on a three on
text: two and dunks it. Derek pump fakes three times and uses
text: the glass for a deuce. Finally, Derek drives the lane
text: and dishes to Seth at the last minute for a bucket.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Yes! Ten a piece! Nice fucking dish.
dialog: 
text: SETH and CURTIS slap Derek's hand as they get back on

dialog: Seth!
text: Seth and the opposing player bang to get position
dialog: underneath.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: I ain't losin' in my house! Clear it
dialog: out!
text: The POWER FORWARD dribbles beautifully up the court --
text: his teammates clearing out the key. Defensively, Derek
text: is solid. He tries to pass Derek but Derek's defense is
text: stifling. Again. With another tricky move, Lawrence
text: inadvertently puts his LEFT ELBOW into Derek's face,
text: sending him quickly to the pavement. EVERYBODY STOPS.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: That's fuckin' offense!
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: Get the fuck outta here! He was
dialog: movin' his feet!
text: Derek, teeth bloodied, rises. The two have a stare down.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: (threateningly)
dialog: I'll go if you want to.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: You wanna piece! Bring it!
text: Players quickly rush to restrain the two even though the

speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: If you wanna go...I'm ready. Don't be
dialog: throwin' fuckin' elbows.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: Fuck you!
text: Derek walks over to Cammeron, Danny and Stacey standing

text: Cameron stares at Derek.
speaker_heading: CAMMERON
dialog: Hey. Are you copacetic?
text: Derek nods and looks at Danny and Stacey.
speaker_heading: CAMMERON
dialog: He's gonna do that 180 spin move.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: I know what he's gonna do.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: You gotta call offense on that shit.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Not on point game you don't.
speaker_heading: STACEY
dialog: Fuck that, D. That chucker can't pull
dialog: that shit. It's fucking-
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Not on point, honey.
text: He turns back to the court and walks over to Lawrence.
text: He stands in front of him and checks the ball in.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Tens!
text: Lawrence takes the ball, passes it to the wing, and
text: quickly gets it back. Lawrence dribbles up top, makes a
text: marvelous 180 spin with the ball, and pulls up for a ten
text: foot jumper. Derek reads it perfectly and REJECTS IT.
text: Lawrence trips to the ground, Derek grabs the ball off
text: the fast break and DUNKS IT.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (amazed by the dunk)
dialog: Holy shit!
text: Everybody courtside goes nuts. Derek walks to the
text: sideline, ignoring all the hand slaps being offered.
text: Everyone is riveted on Derek.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: (to the other team)
dialog: Get off my fucking court! This is my
dialog: house!
speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Forget it, Danny! It ain't gonna

speaker_heading: SETH

speaker_heading: DAVINA

speaker_heading: DEREK

dialog: alley.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT - TIGHT ON DORIS
text: She thinks to herself and closes her eyes.
scene_heading: EXT. SIDE STREET - SETH'S TRUCK
text: Derek looks at the oblivious cops and drops into the
text: passenger's seat. Seth starts the engine and drives
text: away. As the truck disappears, we pick up on a WHITE

scene_heading: INT. DANNY'S BEDROOM - A DESK
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Danny's attention is everywhere except on his homework.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: This sucks.
text: He walks back out of his bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY/LIVING ROOM - DANNY'S POV
text: He watches Davina complete her homework on the couch.
text: Doris, on the sofa opposite, tries to sleep.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: DAVINA
dialog: Hey what?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Come here.
speaker_heading: DAVINA
dialog: What!?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Come here for a second!
text: The scholar sets her homework aside and impatiently
text: follows him down the hall.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - TWO SINGLE BEDS
text: She sits on the edge of DANNY'S bed. Danny hands her his
dialog: assignment instructions.
speaker_heading: DAVINA
dialog: I got shit to do, Dan.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Just read it.
text: She sighs and begins to read it out loud.
speaker_heading: DAVINA
dialog: "American History X? Take home paper
dialog: as assigned by Principal Robert
dialog: Sweeney?"
dialog: (to Danny)
dialog: Why is he giving you homework? What
dialog: happened to Murray?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Asshole turned me in.
speaker_heading: DAVINA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Just read.
speaker_heading: DAVINA
dialog: "Describe in detail your opinion of
dialog: -the historical event that took place
dialog: in the early morning of October 4th,
dialog: 1993." What's that?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: The night Derek wasted those guys.
text: Davina takes a moment.
speaker_heading: DAVINA
dialog: Sweeney gave you this?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: DAVINA
dialog: (continuing her reading)
dialog: "Before and after...how has this event
dialog: helped or hurt your present
dialog: perspective concerning life in
dialog: contemporary America. Use the
dialog: standard five paragraph format, blab
dialog: blab blah--this'll be good for you..
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Nooo...it'll be good for you.
text: She stares at him for a good three seconds.
speaker_heading: DAVINA
dialog: Eat me, Dan.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Come on! Dick Nixon's playin' at
dialog: Cammeron's tonight. You owe me.
speaker_heading: DAVINA
dialog: I'm not doing your homework for you!
dialog: I gotta spreadsheet due!
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Goddammit!
text: Davina walks to the door and looks back to her brother.
speaker_heading: DAVINA
dialog: What's the matter with you? You wanna
dialog: be a fuckin' loser your whole life?
text: Not receiving a response, she walks out the door.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Asshole Sweeney.
text: He slowly begins to strike the computer keys. The screen
dialog: reads "People look at me and they see my brother. That's
dialog: the way things have gone since the murder of our father,"
text: TIGHT ON DANNY. The frustated kid sits and thinks to himself.
dialog: himself.
scene_heading: QUICK CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ESTABLISHING SHOT - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
text: THE BROAD EXPANSE OF AN EMPTY, DIMLY LIT PARKING LOT. In
text: the distant corner we see a few parked cars and a group
dialog: of skins gathering.
speaker_heading: DANNY (V/O)
dialog: It was lunacy after he left us. All
dialog: the time. Derek believed in
dialog: Cammeron...he was angry...that
dialog: combination gave them bodies. White
dialog: punks...sick of gettin' their asses
text: kicked by black and mexican gangs at
dialog: school.
text: TIGHT ON DANNY LEANING AGAINST AN ADJACENT CAR.
text: Seven skins, including Seth and Curtis, smoke and wait.
text: DANNY'S POV. Danny looks to his left and sees Derek with
text: Cammeron, who sits in the driver's seat of the BRONCO.
text: Stacey leans in from the backseat.
speaker_heading: STACEY
dialog: I hope you kill that fucker.
text: Derek looks back at her and straight to Cameron.
speaker_heading: CAMMERON
text: He might have a gun.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Are you going in or not?
speaker_heading: CAMMERON
dialog: You know I got the cops on me. If I
dialog: come up on one of those cameras I'm a
text: dead man.
text: Derek stares at the older man, who appears nervous.
speaker_heading: CAMMERON
dialog: Somebody needs to drive, Derek.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: (referring to his mouth)
dialog: All right. You can turn it off now.
dialog: (back to Stacey)
dialog: You're right on his tail, right?
speaker_heading: STACEY
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: I hate that fucking Korean. I hope
dialog: you smash his face in.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Just be ready, okay?
text: She nods and Derek gets out. The group is silent.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Come on. Let's pull it together.
dialog: Hey! We're not playing fuckin' games
dialog: here. Let's go.
text: The group snaps to attention behind him as Seth toys with
text: the camera. CURTIS from earlier takes a hit off a joint
text: and makes Derek wait for him. Derek walks over to the
text: crazy man, takes the joint, and throws it onto the
dialog: ground.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: What the fuck, Curtis? You a fuckin'
dialog: nigger now? Want some crack?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: (grabbing his neck)
dialog: Pull your fucking stupid head out of
dialog: your ass then.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Okay. Jesus.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: (to the group)
dialog: We're here tonight cause we got
dialog: immigration problems spiralling out of
dialog: control. We got Asians up the ass...
dialog: taking over our land with their
text: fucking Yen. Mexicans...flocking into
dialog: this place like some giant fucking
text: Pinata was shattered.
text: The group busts up. Cammeron watches Derek and smiles.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Don't laugh. It's tragic. On the
dialog: Statue of Liberty it says "Give me
dialog: your tired, your hungry, your poor,
dialog: your huddled masses...yearning to be
dialog: free." It does not say give me your
dialog: shiftless, your greedy, your indolent,
dialog: your criminals, looking for a free
dialog: ticket.
text: The group agrees.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: We're here tonight to show the
dialog: government how we feel about
dialog: minorities taking over our country.
dialog: The treat us like criminals while they
dialog: reward them with jobs and fucking
dialog: welfare checks. And it's only getting
dialog: worse.
speaker_heading: ET AL
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Fuck yeah it is.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Are you ready to do something about
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: ET AL
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Okay then.
text: AND THEY'RE MOVING. In formation. Fast. Directly at
dialog: us. Angry.
text: As the camera swings into line, TRACKING WITH THEM, Derek
text: reaches into his back pocket and pulls out a STOCKING
text: MASK. He pulls it down over his face.
text: The foot soldiers follow him in unison.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: (back to his troops)
dialog: Remember. No names. Danny? Stay
dialog: right on my fucking ass, man.
text: And now they're getting ahead of us. As the CAMERA
text: SWINGS behind them, we see their destination.
scene_heading: EXT. LIGHTED GROCERY STORE - SAME
text: They storm the front entrance. The few people who are in
text: there scream and scramble for cover. Derek grabs a
text: Mexican boxboy and throws him to the ground. Seth
text: catches up to another and gets him on the ground.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Wheto's your fucking green card,
dialog: asshole?
text: Seth kicks the young man in the face with a blatant shot
text: and continues. DEREK leaves a terrified white woman
text: alone like she's not even there and pushes over an
text: adjacent shelf, knocking over another worker with CANS OF
text: BEANS.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: (referring to the border)
dialog: Can't hide from me, motherfucker!
text: He kicks the man and looks around the market for more.
text: Danny watches in awe. Curtis breaks a giant jelly jar
text: over a head. Another skin throws a BLACK CHECKER into a
text: shelf of POTATO CHIPS.
text: DEREK'S POV. He looks up at one of the aisle mirrors.
scene_heading: INT. BACK STOCK AREA - THE 55-YEAR-OLD KOREAN OWNER
text: He rushes out with a pistol. He takes aim on Curtis and--
text: FROM OUT OF NOWHERE, DEREK TAKES A MOP TO THE OWNER'S
text: HEAD AND PROCEEDS TO KICK HIM. Danny looks at Derek like
dialog: he's Superman.
text: Derek looks to his watch and straightens up.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Let's go! We're outta here! Move !
text: From just inside the door we see skins get in their last
text: blows and pour out the aisles and pass us through the
text: doors. TIRES SCREECH. THE CAMERA HOLDS ON THE WRECKAGE
text: OF THE MARKET AND THE MOTIONLESS BODIES ON THE FLOOR;
scene_heading: INT. BRONCO - TIGHT ON DANNY
text: He takes off his stocking mask and stares at his stone-
dialog: faced brother.
speaker_heading: DANNY (V/O)
text: And before Derek could even blink...he
text: had a crazed army behind him.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - PRESENT - THE COMPUTER
text: Danny sparks up a cigarette and types on the screen.
speaker_heading: DANNY (V/O)
dialog: Willing to follow his word like it was
dialog: the word of God.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. VENICE BEACH HOUSE - A RAINY NIGHT - FLASHBACK
text: As the rain falls, we see the Vinyards sitting at the
dialog: table. Stacey and Murray Rosenberg, Doris' then
dialog: boyfriend who we met earlier, round out the clan. Stacey
text: sits close to Derek.
speaker_heading: DANNY (V/O)
dialog: And then came October 4th, 1993.
scene_heading: INT. BEACH HOUSE - THE DINING ROOM
text: Doris looks wonderful while Murray, mustache and beard,
text: shakes his head at Derek as he chatters away.
speaker_heading: DANNY (V/O)
dialog: Things were fine on the homefront. My
dialog: Mom had a good job but a below average
dialog: boyfriend. We had a four-bedroom
dialog: house that Dad left us with. Everyone
dialog: was happy.
text: TIGHT ON DEREK. Shaved head, rolled-up sleeves, tattoos,
text: loosened tie, LA COPY CENTER name tag from earlier. His
text: charisma draws their attention as he rambles over the
text: crackling rainfall.
speaker_heading: DANNY (V/O)
dialog: Everyone but Derek.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Fuck you, Murray. White men don't
dialog: cruise the streets of LA killing each
dialog: other.
speaker_heading: MURRAY
dialog: No. You guys make bombs.
text: Derek stares at the man, eyes filled with homicide.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: You're so fucking lame. A couple of
dialog: cranks in cabins in Montana is not
dialog: statistically significant.
dialog: (then)
dialog: White Americans don't take PCP and
dialog: drink and drive a hundred and twenty
dialog: fuckin' miles an hour! We pull over
dialog: and trust the law.
speaker_heading: MURRAY
dialog: You're kidding, right?
speaker_heading: DAVINA
dialog: (sarcastically)
dialog: Don't you know, Murray? White people
dialog: never break the law. We're perfect
dialog: little angels.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: That's not what I said, Davina.
dialog: (to the group)
dialog: Three different times Rodney King
dialog: comes at those officers with the
dialog: intent to hurt them. To hurt them!
dialog: Three times! But since we see it on
dialog: some fucking tampered videotape...the
dialog: bleeding heart media makes you believe
text: that he only comes at them once. All
dialog: we see is Powell, Koon and Wind
dialog: hittin' him and--
dialog: (busting up laughing)
text: Briseno kickin' him in the back of the
dialog: fuckin' skull with his boot. Still,
dialog: the dumbfuck's tryin' to get up and
dialog: kick their asses! That's how stupid
dialog: that motherfucker is. Those cops used
dialog: textbook-solid tactics and if Dad were
dialog: still here he'd say the same damn
dialog: thing.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: That doesn't make it right.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Yes it does. Yes it does. They're
dialog: cops! They are taught to use that
dialog: stick and they did.
speaker_heading: MURRAY
text: Excessively.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: No. Appropriately. Appropriately!
dialog: Cops have been granted a certain
dialog: amount of authority by society and
dialog: white people, unfortunately, are the
dialog: only ones who acknowledge it. I
text: acknowledge a cop's authority.
text: Davina starts to laugh.
speaker_heading: DAVINA
dialog: Look who's talking about respecting
dialog: the law? Mr. K.K.K. here.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: That's two errors in one sentence,
dialog: Davina, so take a fucking course in
dialog: semantics. First error--I didn't say
dialog: I respect the law. I said I respect a
dialog: cop's authority. Second error...I'm
dialog: not a member of the fuckin' low rent,
text: disorganized, redneck Ku Klux Klan..
dialog: Pull your head outta your ass and look
dialog: at who you're dealing with.
speaker_heading: MURRAY
dialog: Don't speak to her that way, Derek.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Murray, stay out of it. You're not a
dialog: member of this family and you never
dialog: will be.
speaker_heading: MURRAY
dialog: What the hell does that have to do
dialog: with anything?
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: (to Derek)
dialog: You know...sometimes it's hard to
dialog: believe I gave birth to you.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Give thanks to the food on the table
dialog: and then believe it, Doris.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: We both put food on this table, fella.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: True enough. The point is...if Dan
text: was walking across the street that
text: night and Rodney King plowed into him--
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: Can we forget about Rodney King for
dialog: chrissake?!
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: (fiercely continuing)
dialog: --while hopped up on Chivas and
dialog: P.C.P...you'd consider the force those
dialog: cops used to be justified!
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: He didn't hit anybody!
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: If he did though! If that shithead
dialog: killed Dan...you would have believed
dialog: the beating to be justified and so
dialog: would everybody else. But since he
dialog: didn't hit anyone...it's "Hands Across
dialog: America" for the son of a bitch.
text: Derek takes a bite of food.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: We are still so hung up in this notion
dialog: that we have an obligation to help the
dialog: struggling black man and all you
dialog: contribute to it! Lincoln freed the
dialog: slaves a hundred and thirty years ago!
dialog: Get off your fucking asses!
speaker_heading: STACEY
dialog: I'm with you, honey. All the way.
dialog: It's one...giant...ploy.
speaker_heading: DAVINA
dialog: Here we go.
speaker_heading: STACEY
dialog: I mean...nobody likes Chief whatever
dialog: his name is, right?
speaker_heading: DAVINA
dialog: Gates.
speaker_heading: STACEY
dialog: Yeah. So here comes this filthy piece
text: of garbage in his Hyundai. He pulls
text: over in front of a perfectly lighted
text: area where a video camera is sitting
dialog: there...fucking waiting for him, man.
dialog: What happens next? Chief Gates is
dialog: dust. It's total--
text: Davina drops her silverware on the plate with a clatter
text: and looks at her mother. Everyone stares at Davina.
speaker_heading: DAVINA
dialog: (to Doris)
dialog: May I be excused please?
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Don't interrupt, Davina.
speaker_heading: DAVINA
dialog: I didn't interrupt shit.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: The hell you didn't. I was listening
dialog: to Stacey and then I heard you.
dialog: That's called interrupting. Wait 'til
dialog: she's finished and you can be excused.
speaker_heading: DAVINA
dialog: Who the hell do you think you are?
text: Derek jumps up from the table and grabs her by the back
text: of the hair. The table JOLTS and plates tumble to zhe
dialog: floor.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: You don't know when to shut up.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: Dammit Derek!
speaker_heading: MURRAY
dialog: What are you trying to prove, man?!
text: Derek turns and laughs at Murray.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: I'm trying to teach my sister some
dialog: respect, Murray.
speaker_heading: DAVI NA
dialog: Let go of my fucking hair!
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: (to Murray)
dialog: See! See the way she speaks! Tell me
dialog: you're gonna shut up and I'll let go.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: Derek! Let go of her hair and sit
dialog: down!
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: I will when I hear an answer, Doris.
dialog: Are you going to shut up, Davina?
text: TIGHT ON DANNY. He gets up quickly and tries to pull
text: Derek off. Derek turns and cracks Danny in the face with
text: a BACKHAND, dropping him back into a cabinet. A crystal
text: vase with flowers crashes to the floor, just missing
text: Danny's head.
speaker_heading: MURRAY
dialog: Jesus!
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: (to Danny)
dialog: What are you thinkin'?
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: Danny?! Are you okay?!
text: Danny nods his head as everyone looks at Derek.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: It's a real easy question, Davina. A
dialog: simple yes or no will suffice. Tell
dialog: me what I want to hear and I'll let
dialog: go.
speaker_heading: DAVINA
dialog: Fuck...you.
text: Derek takes a piece of roast beef off her plate and
text: shoves it in her mouth. Me holds the whole piece inside
text: so she can't spit it out. Davina cries as she chokes on
dialog: the meat.
speaker_heading: MURRAY
dialog: She can't breathe, Derek!
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Stay back, both of you! It's her bed,
dialog: she's gotta lie in it.
dialog: (grabbing harder)
dialog: You can cry all you want, Davina. I'm
dialog: not gonna let go until you tell me
dialog: what I wanna hear! Are you going to
dialog: shut that fat fucking mouth of your's
dialog: and let my girlfriend tell her
dialog: opinion? Are you?!
text: DORIS grabs him from behind and he aggressively turns on
text: her. Derek curls his tongue behind his teeth and raises
text: his arm like he's actually going to smack his mother.
text: She grabs his arm though, forcefully.
speaker_heading: DORIS
text: Let go of her hair and get out.
text: Derek releases his grip on his sister and she spits the
text: roast beef onto the floor. She runs into the back
text: bedroom crying, choking and coughing.
speaker_heading: DAVINA (O.S)
dialog: I hate you, you fucking asshole!
text: The door slams shut in the background. Doris, Murray,
text: Danny, and Stacey all stare at Derek. Derek calmly faces
dialog: his brother.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: You okay?
text: Danny nods.
speaker_heading: MURRAY
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Psycho.
text: IN SLO MO--Time FREEZES as Derek slowly turns his head
text: back to Murray. ON THE TRACK we hear a few keys being
text: typed and then silence. A cigarette sizzles.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - DANNY THINKING - PRESENT
text: He takes a long drag off his cigarette and exhales. He
text: slowly runs his hands over his stubbly head, marveling at
dialog: the past.
scene_heading: BACK QUICKLY TO:
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - TIGHT ON DEREK - FLASHBACK CONT.
text: Derek smiles at Murray in wonder and disbelief.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Would you care to repeat that, Murray?
dialog: I'm not sure I got all of it.
speaker_heading: STACEY
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: He called you a "psycho", honey.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: (smiling back)
dialog: Was that it? Thanks Murray.
speaker_heading: MURRAY
dialog: See. Here we go again with this,
dialog: Derek. Making me out to be the bad
dialog: guy again.
speaker_heading: STACEY
dialog: You callin' me a liar, RosenKike?
speaker_heading: MURRAY
dialog: (to Stacey)
dialog: Hey goddammit! You talk to me with
dialog: respect or--!
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Or what, Murray!? What're you gonna
dialog: do? Give her fucking detention?
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: Both of you get out right now.
text: Murray stares at Derek with pity. Doris becomes
dialog: emotional.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: (to Derek)
dialog: Do you think you're the only one who's
dialog: affected around here?
text: Derek focuses on his mother for a moment. A captivated
text: Danny watches and waits as Derek turns to Murray.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Out of respect for my mother...I'm
dialog: gonna let that comment go, Murray. I
dialog: won't bash your face in. But let me
dialog: tell you somethin'...man to fuckin'
dialog: mouse here. Normally in a situation
dialog: like this I'd take my steel-tips to
dialog: your fucking Jewish temple. That goes
dialog: for anyone making comments about me,
dialog: my family, Stacey, whomever. You know
dialog: and I know that I could crush that
dialog: puny fuckin' skull of yours in a
dialog: second. So it's beyond me why you
dialog: would say something like that without
dialog: being able to back it up? What's
dialog: worse, you sack of shit, is you
dialog: calling the woman I love a liar.
speaker_heading: MURRAY
dialog: I never said she was a liar.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Weasel like that again Murray...you
dialog: fuckin' ponytail, pussy, bagel eating,
dialog: teacher, faggot...and I'll cut your
dialog: shylock nose off. Make no mistake.
text: Murray silently walks out of the house. Derek claps and
text: sings the Jewish celebration song "Hava Naghila." Stacey
text: joins in and the two laugh. Doris goes after Murray.
speaker_heading: STACEY
dialog: Murray Rosenberg...International Jew.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: Murray goes to his car and Doris follows. Danny watches
text: from the door.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: He's a stupid kid, Murray! I'm sorry!
speaker_heading: MURRAY
dialog: He's not a kid, Doris. We were kids.
dialog: We didn't call people kikes.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: It's just gonna take some time with
dialog: him. What can I do?
speaker_heading: MURRAY
dialog: You don't know your children, Doris!
dialog: You have no clue about the world they
dialog: live in. Your son is a terrorist.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: He's not a terrorist, Murray. Jesus!
speaker_heading: MURRAY
dialog: He's a member of the Disciples of
dialog: Christ. You remember that grocery
dialog: store incident?!
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: Murray?
speaker_heading: MURRAY
dialog: My sister and her two kids got
dialog: evacuated from her Temple in Woodland
dialog: Hills!
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: Murray! Please! Derek would never
dialog: have anything to do with bombs, okay?!
dialog: You don't know him like I do.
speaker_heading: MURRAY
dialog: And I wouldn't want to. Goodbye.
text: Murray gets inside and goes down the street.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - SAME
text: DANNY'S POV -- He watches Doris stand alone, her face in
text: her hands, crying.
text: BEHIND Dan a humiliated Davina storms towards Derek, now
text: wielding a BASEBALL BAT.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Davina?
text: Derek hears Dan and looks out of the corner of his eye.
text: He spots her at the last moment.
speaker_heading: DAVINA
dialog: Take this, you fucking dick!
text: Derek pops up quickly, disarms her, and pulls her close.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Davina! It's okay! Calm down.
dialog: Please.
speaker_heading: DAVINA
dialog: Fuck you! Let go!
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: (whispering in her ear)
dialog: I'm sorry, Davina. Come on.
speaker_heading: DAVINA
dialog: Let go of me!
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Come on, Davina. I'm sorry. I lost
dialog: control. Please. I screwed up.
text: Derek holds tight until the crying girl settles down.
text: He's gripped as desperately by remorse as he was moments
text: before by rage. He kisses and repeats his apology over
text: and over. Finally, she succumbs and puts her arms around
text: him. Derek looks to Danny.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: (hugging Davina)
dialog: You guys are my life and I'd do
dialog: anything for you. You do know that?
speaker_heading: DAVINA
dialog: (wiping her tears)
dialog: I don't believe you anymore.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: I swear to God I would, Davina.
dialog: Please.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I believe you, Der.
text: Derek smiles at his little brother, lovingly.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Davina? Please forgive me. Please.
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: DAVINA
dialog: (nodding, after a beat)
dialog: That fuckin' sucked, Derek.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: I know it did. And I'm sorry.
dialog: I just really hate that guy.
speaker_heading: DAVINA
dialog: You couldn't tell.
text: A RAINSOAKED DORIS walks through the front door.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: Find an apartment because I want you
dialog: out of here.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Morn, I'm sorry but that guy's--
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: I don't wanna hear it anymore! I want
dialog: you out!
speaker_heading: STACEY
dialog: He can move in with me.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: STACEY
dialog: Tomorrow.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: Good.
text: She walks past Derek and into the back bedroom.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - TIGHT ON DANNY'S EYES - PRESENT
text: He rises from the computer and PEEKS out the blinds. The
text: two cops supposedly watching Derek are now eating in the
text: car. One of them looks up. Danny flips the blinds down.
text: From the other room, he hears Doris break into another
text: coughing fit.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - DANNY
text: He sits beside her and hands her a glass of water.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Here.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: Thank you, honey.
text: She coughs, recovers, and sips. Danny walks away.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: Hey. Come here. Sit with me.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I've got this thing to do.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: You can sit down for two seconds.
text: He looks at her and sits beside her.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Don't breathe on me.
speaker_heading: DORIS

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: What? I'm not allowed to look at you
dialog: anymore?
text: He smothers her face with his hand, jokingly.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: No. You're not.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Daniel Patrick! Stop it! Are you
dialog: ever gonna let that beautiful hair
dialog: grow back?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Nope. Never.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: I bet you will.
text: He smiles and locks eyes with his mother for several
text: moments. He finally rises and walks back to his room.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Get some sleep.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: If you need me to proof anything for
dialog: you I will.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I'll be all right.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: Wake up early if you get tired.
text: Doris watches him disappear down the hall, distant
text: thoughts creeping back slowly.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM CLOSET - DANNY
text: He grabs a flannel and throws it on. He sees a cigar box
text: that rests on the right shelf. He grabs it and looks
text: inside. The rolled-up LA TIMES clipping reads "Prominent
text: Skinhead Charged with Murder." The accompanying picture
text: of Derek is near evil.
text: TIGHT ON HIS EYES. Danny stares at the clipping. ON THE
scene_heading: TRACK--GUNSHOTS.
scene_heading: MATCH CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM WINDOW - THE EYES - FLASHBACK
text: He watches Derek fire his gun at the TRANS AM as it
text: blazes down the street. He walks over to the wounded man

speaker_heading: STACEY (O.S.)
dialog: Get on the floor, Danny! Jesus!
text: Danny looks down at her and hurries out of his room.
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE - TIGHT ON DEREK
text: He hovers over big Lawrence. Gun pointed steadily, he
text: kicks him in the stomach over and over -- tongue pressed
text: against teeth. Hot air flows from Derek's breath and
text: into the cold.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: You fucked with the wrong bull.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: Goddamn, man!
text: Danny watches his brother from the front porch.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Let the cops handle it, Der!
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Fuck that. The cops will let him
dialog: walk.
text: Derek grabs Lawrence and drags him to the CURB.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Ever shoot at firemen, you fuck?
dialog: (then)
dialog: Open your mouth and put it on the
dialog: corner of the curb. I'm gonna teach
dialog: you a little lesson.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Derek!?
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Get in the fucking house, Dan!
text: Danny doesn't move.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: Come on, man. Call an ambulance.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: My dad gave me that truck,
dialog: motherfucker. Couldn't leave well
dialog: enough alone. Put your mouth on the
dialog: corner of the fucking curb!
text: Derek cocks his piece and Lawrence complies--his teeth
text: now scraping concrete. SIRENS sound from afar. Danny
text: walks out into the middle of the street to check it out.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: The cops are comin' Der'
dialog: 
text: Lawrence mumbles something unintelligible from his
text: outstretched mouth.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: What the fuck did you say? You just
dialog: threaten me? Hunh? Hunh? Hunh?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (anticipating)
dialog: No!
text: Derek STOMPS his foot on the back of LAWRENCE'S head -
text: completely tearing his jaw in half on the curb's corner.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (crying)
dialog: Holy fucking shit! Derek! What the
dialog: hell was that for?! Jesus!
text: The two lock eyes. Derek does not flinch. Helicopter
text: lights shine on the house. COP CARS SCREECH TO A HALT.
text: DANNY'S POV. Two cops take cover behind their door, draw
text: their guns, and shout instructions. Derek puts the gun
text: down, puts his arms behind his head, and drops to his
text: knees. His eyes are remorseless.
speaker_heading: DANNY (V/O)
dialog: Joseph Conrad once wrote that "murder
dialog: is always with us. It's almost an
dialog: institution." That couldn't rang more
dialog: true than with me.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. WET STREET - THE CRIME SCENE - LATER

dialog: Penitentiary in Chino.
text: Rasmussen forces Derek's head down and he gets in the

text: lights flash on him. Then to Stacey. Finally, to a
text: lifeless Doris. They lock eyes as the patrol car takes
text: off down the street.
speaker_heading: DANNY (V/O)
dialog: Prosecutors wanted murder one for my

speaker_heading: DANNY (V/O)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Over the next year we'd lose our house

scene_heading: INT. FRONT HALL - DANNY'S POV

scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - THE THREESOME
text: Danny looks at the two.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: If I don't finish this thing I'm dead.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Just tell 'em you'll do it tomorrow.

speaker_heading: JASON

speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: CHRIS

text: The PHONE RINGS and Danny grabs it.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Hello?
scene_heading: INT. DARK OFFICE - TIGHT ON SWEENEY

speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: Just make sure it's on my desk
dialog: tomorrow, Danny.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: It'll be there, alright!?
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: It better be.

speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: You're an idiot if you ask me.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: I'm not asking you.
speaker_heading: SETH

text: Derek takes a long stare at Seth, who devourshis burger.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Sweeney's not gonna do anything, Seth.

speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: I'm out, Seth.
text: Seth wipes his mouth and casually meets eyes with Derek.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: I'm only going to tell you this once
dialog: so pay attention. I'm done, Seth. I
dialog: don't want you to come near me...near

speaker_heading: CHRIS

speaker_heading: CAMMERON

speaker_heading: STACEY

speaker_heading: CAMMERON
dialog: You made it, man. When I heard they

speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: It wasn't too bad.
speaker_heading: CAMMERON
dialog: So what's all this self-righteous,

speaker_heading: CAMMERON

speaker_heading: CAMMERON

speaker_heading: DEREK

speaker_heading: CAMMERON

speaker_heading: CAMMERON

speaker_heading: DEREK

text: forcefully backs Derek into the wall behind him. He

text: to the face that opens his lip. He misses on his third
text: and Derek gets the upper hand.
text: BACK TO THE MIRROR. Derek prepares to crash Cam's face
text: into the shards of glass one last time. The final blow.
text: As Cam screams, Derek launches him forward then pulls

dialog: exits.
scene_heading: EXT. SHED AREA - A GROUP OF 20 NAZI'S

speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Let him go, Seth.

speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Where's Cameron?
text: Derek stares directly into the BARREL.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (frightened)

speaker_heading: CAMMERON
dialog: (looking at the two)
dialog: Is there anything sacred in this

speaker_heading: CAMMERON

speaker_heading: BLACK MAN
dialog: No questions.
speaker_heading: CAMMERON
dialog: I recommend either the "Big Ben

dialog: Ben'll replace the dark meat with the

speaker_heading: BLACK MAN
dialog: (fed up)
dialog: What's your problem, pal?
speaker_heading: CAMMERON
dialog: I ain't your fucking pal first of all.

speaker_heading: WHITE GIRL
dialog: Come on. Let's get out of here.
speaker_heading: CAMMERON
dialog: Hey! What a great idea! You got a

speaker_heading: BLACK MAN

speaker_heading: SETH

speaker_heading: BLACK MAN
dialog: My name's not Tyrone either.
speaker_heading: SETH

speaker_heading: WHITE GIRL

speaker_heading: CAMMERON
dialog: What the luck difference does it make

dialog: it became fuckin' Africa-America.
speaker_heading: BLACK MAN
dialog: You ignorant mother--
text: Seth quickly gets out of his chair and makes his gun
text: totally visible to the couple.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: You got a fuckin' death wish, asshole?
dialog: Do you? Make your move now if you do.
dialog: If you don't...get the luck out of my
dialog: sight. Cause I'm real close to
dialog: shoving my piece up your girlfriend's
text: stinky pussy.
text: The black man stares at the gun sticking out of Seth's
text: belly. He grabs his girlfriend and walks out of the
text: joint. Seth sits back down and the two laugh. Cameron
text: looks over at Ben and raises his hands in the air.
speaker_heading: CAMMERON
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Everything's hunky dory, Ben! No
dialog: problemo. Only us white folk.

dialog: Did you "save" it?

speaker_heading: CAMMERON
dialog: I used to think that too but...it's

speaker_heading: DEREK

text: Inside, a black woman orders a dozen doughnuts from a

speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: What's goin' on?
speaker_heading: SWEENEY

speaker_heading: DEREK

speaker_heading: SWEENEY

speaker_heading: RASMUSSEN
text: Cammeron and Seth are in the ICU at

speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: How bad?
speaker_heading: RASMUSSEN
dialog: They'll live.

speaker_heading: SWEENEY

speaker_heading: DEREK

speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: I don't know.

speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: Try, Derek. Okay?

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Yeah.
text: The two stare at each other as THE BELL RINGS.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I gotta turn that paper in.

speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Come here.
text: Derek puts his hand over the fence. Danny walks up and
text: clasps it -- FINGERS INTERTWINED. Derek wants to say one
text: thing but something else comes out.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: I'll see you at home.
text: Danny smiles at his brother and nods. Danny puts his ear
text: phones on and heads to class. Derek watches his brother
text: through the chain-link fence. Danny meets up with Lizzy
text: and they soon disappear from Derek's sight. Derek turns
text: and walks down the street.
speaker_heading: COP #1
dialog: You need a lift anywhere?
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Nope.

text: and stares at the school.
scene_heading: INT. MESSY HALLWAY - DANNY AND LIZZY

scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL BATHROOM - SAME
text: Danny enters, sets his "AMERICAN HISTORY X" PAPER on top
text: of the sink, and takes an unearthly long piss at the
text: urinal. He finishes, flushes and turns.

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Jesus Christ. What are you doing,
dialog: Henry?
speaker_heading: LITTLE HENRY
dialog: (afraid)
dialog: What does it look like I'm doin'?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Come on, man, no. You don't want to
dialog: do this. Come on. Henry?
text: THE DOOR SMACKS OPEN and Danny moves to grab the pistol.
text: It discharges and a bullet rockets into Danny's chest.
text: He SLAMS back into the URINAL and gasps for air. The
text: force of the pistol knocks Henry to the ground. The two
text: kids who just entered bolt for help.
text: Danny slides to the tile, leaving a bloody trail. The
text: two stare at each other - EYE TO EYE. THE BLOODSTAINED
text: PAPER falls into the DAMP SINK. Danny inhales like glass
text: is raking his lungs.
speaker_heading: LITTLE HENRY
dialog: (terrified)
dialog: Danny?
text: Danny's breathing slows to a choked whisper. He blinks,
text: coughs, twitches. And dies.
speaker_heading: LITTLE HENRY
dialog: Vinyard? Danny?
text: Henry watches teary-eyed with the same altered look Derek
text: had after killing Lawrence. Together they FREEZE on the

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HALL AT VENICE HIGH BATHROOM - YELLOW POLICE TAPE
text: Officers and detectives monitor the area. Young
text: students, including Lizzy and her friends, stand around

text: Sweeney. Sweeney looks at it for a moment but is
dialog: interrupted.
speaker_heading: RASMUSSEN
dialog: He won't let go. Will you talk to
dialog: him?
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - TIGHT ON DEREK AND DANNY
text: Derek cradles his bloody brother. Sweeney walks over,
text: crouches, and talks to Derek's back.
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: Derek? You gotta let him go, man.
dialog: They gotta get him outta here.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: I can't.
text: Derek begins to cry outright. He can't control himself.
text: He lets go of Danny's corpse and charges out into the
dialog: hall.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - DORIS AND DAVINA
text: Derek embraces them. Doris grabs his face -- torn
text: between love and hate. Guilt-ridden, Derek tears from
text: them and storms down the hall with Sweeney soon in tow.
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: Derek! I know what you're thinkin'
dialog: right now and I want you to forget
dialog: about it!
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: How the luck do you know what I'm
dialog: thinkin', Sweeney!?
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: Cause I'm thinkin' the same damn
dialog: thing!
text: Drowning in rage, Derek turns back to a misty eyed
dialog: Sweeney.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: They shot him in a fucking...pisshole!
speaker_heading: SWEENEY
dialog: And goin' after them won't bring him
dialog: back. Don't do it, Derek. Please,
dialog: man. You've come too far. The war is
dialog: over.
text: Derek contemplates the situation and presses his tongue
text: against his teeth, crackbrained. Sweeney slowly
text: approaches and cautiously wraps his arms around the young
text: man. Derek buries his tearing face in Sweeney's
dialog: shoulder.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: It stops now, Sweeney.
text: Sweeney nods and the two lock eyes. Derek makes his way
text: back to Doris and Davina and together, they grieve.
speaker_heading: DANNY (V/O)

dialog: Bible quote become cliche: "Vengeance
dialog: is mine, sayeth the Lord."
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL BATHROOM - DANNY AND HENRY
text: A still of the two immediately after the murder. We move
text: in tighter and tighter until we get close on Danny.
speaker_heading: DANNY (V/O)
dialog: Vengeance brought about by hate...and
text: fear. When it points its head in our
dialog: direction, we take notice and
dialog: everything changes. The way we choose
dialog: our friends, the way we protect our
dialog: families, the way we create enemies
text: out of strangers.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Welcome to America.
text: TIGHT ON DANNY'S EYES. They are gently pushed shut by
