scene_heading: EXT. CITY - DAY
speaker_heading: CREDITS OVER:
text: Businessmen and women fill the sidewalks, clutching their
text: winter coats shut. Most wear gloves and hats, though they
text: provide little respite from the blustery Midwestern winds.
text: Salt-stained Taxis jockey for position. Steam billows from
text: manhole covers and metal grates. Metro train cars, filled to
text: capacity, howl across the frigid track.
scene_heading: HIGH-RISE BUILDING
text: The revolving door spins like a carousel, filled with the
text: briefcase-carrying denizens of this busy financial center.
text: A sign, situated high above the front security desk:
scene_heading: “STARKWEATHER FINANCIAL.”
text: A large Christmas wreath hangs above the sign.
text: The elevator door starts to close. A hand shoots in, stops
text: it. The door reopens.
text: DAVID HARGROVE, 27, more handsome than he probably realizes,
text: climbs into the crowded elevator. The other occupants barely
text: move. The door closes -- inches from David’s face.
speaker_heading: DING.
text: WE TRACK WITH DAVID as he:
text: Exits onto his floor...
text: Walks through the cubicle farm, past the other middle-income
dialog: earners and entry-level employees...
text: Sits down in his cubicle. Tosses his car keys into a plastic
text: cup filled with pocket change, next to his small desk clock
text: that reads 8:29AM...
text: Pours himself a cup of coffee in the break room...
text: Talks on his office phone, while sneaking in bites from a
dialog: sandwich...
text: The wall clock shows 1:30PM...
text: He removes a tall stack of files from a drawer and drops them
text: on his desk...
text: Talks on the phone some more. Stressed out...
text: David's small, desk clock shows 4:42PM...
text: He enters data into a computer program...
text: Finally lets out a deep sigh.
dialog: Just another day.
speaker_heading: END CREDITS
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. STARKWEATHER FINANCIAL - LATER
text: It’s now dark outside. Fluorescent light fills the
text: antiseptic office. People work into the night.
text: The wall clock reads 7:14PM.
text: David sits at his desk, talking on the phone. Or, better
text: described, being talked to.
text: His tie unloosened, his hair mussed, he fails in his efforts
dialog: to keep stress at bay.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Right...I understand. But, there’s
dialog: so many variables that come into
dialog: play in a market like this.
text: The voice from the other end of the phone is unintelligible,
text: but its tone is unmistakably hostile.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: If you'd like, we can explore
dialog: shifting what's left in your 401K
dialog: into...I see.
text: COREY THOMPSON, 28, David’s somewhat overbearing and
text: audacious friend and coworker, overhears the conversation.
dialog: Tunes in.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Yes. Yes, sir, I know Christmas is
dialog: coming. I understand. I’m sorry,
dialog: Mister Dean. Truly, I’m sorry. I
dialog: spread the investment risk as wide
dialog: as I could.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s just the unfortunate state of
dialog: the economy we’re all --
text: From the other end of the phone, we hear the muffled sound of
text: what sounds a lot like a string of curse words.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello? Hello, Mister Dean...?
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: Shit.
text: David hangs up the phone. Buries his face in his hands.
text: Rubs his temples.
text: Corey wheels back in his chair. Leans into David’s cubicle.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: You lose him?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What gave it away?
text: David powers down his computer.
text: Corey takes a candy cane off David’s desk. Tears open the
text: plastic wrapper. Pops it into his mouth.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Candy canes taste like shit.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I wouldn’t know.
text: Corey smirks.
text: David looks at himself in the reflection of his powered down
text: computer monitor. His button-down shirt. His loosened tie.
text: His messy hair. Corey notices his dejected expression.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Hey, it’s not your fault.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (sarcastically)
dialog: Oh no, who’s fault is it then?
dialog: (sincere now)
dialog: I’ve never even met this guy. Just
dialog: moved some numbers around on the
dialog: computer and now he’s fucked.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Everyone’s fucked. So stop moping.
text: David shrugs his acknowledgment.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Maybe I should have taken today
dialog: off.
text: Corey looks across the office. Sees EMILY BRANDT, 25,
text: attractive, chatting with a coworker.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: (re: Emily)
dialog: Ah, but then you would have missed
dialog: your chance.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Today’s her last day.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: She's quitting?
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: That’s what I hear.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No...
text: He watches Emily as she walks back toward her cubicle.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Stop being such a bitch and go ask
dialog: her out.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I tried that a year ago. I made an
dialog: ass out myself.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Yeah, because you couldn’t say the
dialog: word date. What did you call it
dialog: again...?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I asked her if she wanted to meet
dialog: up for...a gathering.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: A gathering? What is she, a
dialog: fucking wizard?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No idea why I said it.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: You're right, you did make an ass
dialog: out yourself.
text: David ignores Corey. Collects the last of his belongings.
speaker_heading: COREY (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, come on -- I’m just
dialog: messing with you. Go talk to her.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I can’t.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Why can’t you?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Because...I left my balls at home.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Not again.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: Yup, right there on the dresser.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Next to your nightgown?
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: Right next to it. In fact, it’s
dialog: probably covering them a little
text: bit, keeping them warm.
speaker_heading: COREY
text: Like a male penguin.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Like a male penguin. I don’t know
dialog: what that means.
text: David grabs his jacket and car keys.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: I’1l see you on Monday.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: What about the Christmas party?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Eh...
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Don’t give me “eh.” We're meeting
dialog: everyone at Max’s in, like, twenty
dialog: minutes.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Shouldn’t I go home and change
dialog: first?
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: You're fine; everybody's going
text: straight from the office.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh...I get it now. Male penguins
dialog: sit on the eggs to keep them
dialog: warm...like my balls.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: You got it right away. Stop trying
dialog: to change the subject -- the
dialog: party’s going to be fun.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Are Jerry and Luke going?
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Yeah. Everybody from our
dialog: department is. Besides, I need a
dialog: ride.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You know all those yellow cars out
dialog: there? It’s crazy, all you need to
dialog: do is give them some money and they
dialog: drive you wherever --
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: -- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just give me
dialog: a second. I gotta’ take a piss.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (through a smile)
dialog: I’m not going.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Yeah you are. You wanna’ know why?
text: David's already given up. Raises his eyebrows to say “Why?”
speaker_heading: COREY (CONT'D)
dialog: (re: Emily)
dialog: Because she’s going, too.
text: Corey walks off, leaving David to reconsider, and then yells
text: from afar.
speaker_heading: COREY (CONT'D)
dialog: This is going to be a big night for
dialog: you, bro. I can feel it.
scene_heading: INT. MAX'S - LATER
text: Busy bar scene. Young professionals enjoy after-work drinks
dialog: at their company Christmas party. Some enjoy too many,
text: evidenced by Corey’s obvious inebriation.
text: He and David sit at a table, along with coworkers CHRISTIAN,
text: JERRY, and LUKE. High-ball glasses cover the table. Corey’s
text: iPhone also sits on the table, in front of him.
text: Emily stands across the room, speaking with friends at the
dialog: bar.
text: Back at the table, Corey holds court.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: So I purposely order the pizza at,
dialog: like, three minutes before
dialog: midnight.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: On New Year’s Eve?
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (to the group)
dialog: What’s going on for New Year’s this
dialog: year?
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Who gives a shit? I’m not done
dialog: with my story.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: It’s going to be Easter by the time
dialog: you are.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Yeah, whatever. Go fuck yourself.
dialog: Anyway...where was I?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: New Year’s. You ordered a pizza.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Right, right. So, three minutes
text: passes, the ball drops, it’s
dialog: officially the new year. Lo and
dialog: behold, ten minutes later there’s a
dialog: knock on my door.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Was it the point of the story
dialog: finally showing up?
text: David listens in. Laughs. Glances over at the bar, where he
text: sees Emily. She looks back at him. Their gaze holds for a
text: moment, but then they both look away.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: It was the pizza guy. So, I tell
dialog: him, “You better not be charging me
dialog: for this. I ordered the fucking
dialog: thing last year!”
text: The punchline receives a few courtesy chuckles.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Did you end up paying?
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: No. The kid apologized and --
text: As Corey plops back down into his seat, Corey accidentally
text: bangs into the table and knocks his iPhone onto the floor.
text: He doesn’t notice.
text: He also spills everyone's drinks. That, everyone notices.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: Ah, man. What the hell?
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Shit. My bad, my bad.
text: Corey pulls out his wallet. Grabs all his cash. Calls over
text: a COCKTAIL WAITRESS.
speaker_heading: COREY (CONT'D)
dialog: (hands her all his cash)
dialog: Sweetie, here. Bring a bottle of
dialog: tequila to the table. Best stuff
dialog: you got.
scene_heading: COCKTAIL WAITRESS
dialog: It’s five more dollars.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Oh...um...
text: Corey searches his pockets.
text: David stands up and places a ten dollar bill on the Cocktail
text: Waitresses’ tray. He walks away from the table.
text: WE STAY ON DAVID as he crosses the bar. Readies himself.
text: Approaches the bar, next to Emily. Tries to make his
dialog: selection of that spot seem random.
text: He signals the bartender.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (to the bartender)
dialog: Another beer. Thanks.
text: He turns and looks at Emily.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh...hey, Emily.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Hi, David.
text: The bartender brings David his beer.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (to Emily)
dialog: Did you want anything?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: No, I’m good, thanks. I’m leaving,
dialog: actually.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I heard that.
text: Emily’s slightly confused.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: You heard I was leaving?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah. Corey told me you got a job
text: at an NPO.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Oh, right...I did. I meant I was
dialog: leaving...never mind.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, congrats. Needed a change, I
dialog: guess.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Thanks, yeah I think I’ve gone
dialog: about as far as I can handle in
dialog: finance.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I know what you mean.
text: Neither of them seems to know where to go from here. The
text: extended silence is a bit awkward.
speaker_heading: EMILY (CONT'D)
dialog: So...I should probably get going.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Right...
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Thanks for the drink -- well, the
dialog: offer.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Of course. Yeah. And, ah, you
dialog: know...maybe I’1l catch you
dialog: later...or something.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Umm...yeah.
text: Emily grabs her coat and purse. Walks off.
text: David winces. Dies a little on the inside.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - SECONDS LATER
text: Cars and taxis speed past. Their exhaust mixes with the cold
text: air, clouding up the street.
text: Emily walks from the bar and is instantly hit by an achingly
text: cold gust of wind. She extends a shivering arm to signal a
text: cab, but it passes her by.
text: David exits the bar, carrying a winter hat. Catches up to
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Emily, wait...
text: Emily turns to face who called her. Sees it’s David. A
text: hopeful smile crosses her face.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: You forgot your hat.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Oh...that’s not mine.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Shit. Did I just steal a hat?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I think you may have.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, consider it a going away
dialog: present...from whoever owns it.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I’m not going far. My new office
text: is only a few blocks uptown.
text: David goes for broke.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Want to grab lunch some time?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Ummm....
text: Crash and burn. David quickly recoils.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It’s cool. I understand...
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: No, no -- I would. Sorry. I’m
dialog: nervous.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Nervous? About what?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: About this. About us talking right
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Yes.
text: She reaches out to another passing taxi.
dialog: 12.
text: It, too, does not stop. She grows frustrated. Cold. She
text: moves to a spot further down the street. David walks with
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We've talked plenty of times
dialog: before.
text: Wearing only his button-down work shirt, the cold is already
text: taking its toll on David. He folds his arms for warmth.
text: Tries to rub life back into his limbs.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: At work, yeah. You’d call me at my
dialog: desk, ask me about a financial
dialog: report, but that was it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I never cared about the reports.
text: They smile at each other. Their breath escapes into the cold
text: nighttime air.
text: A cab speeds past. Emily misses the chance to signal it.
text: Standing in the spot she stood moments ago are two women.
text: The cab stops for them and they climb in.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: (re: the missed cab)
dialog: Damn it...
text: A bone-chilling gust of wind blows through. Emily clutches
text: her coat closer to her chest and neck. David turns away
text: slightly, letting the brunt of the wind hit his back.
dialog: Once it passes:
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I can give you a ride home.
text: Emily considers it, but then:
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I live outside the city. It’s
dialog: really out of the way.
text: Another cab passes without stopping.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Come on, it’s freezing out here.
dialog: I‘1l grab my jacket and we'll go.
text: More cold wind blows through. It chills them to the bone.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: That would be great. Thanks.
text: He hurries back toward the bar. Emily yells over to him.
speaker_heading: EMILY (CONT'D)
dialog: You should probably return that
dialog: hat.
scene_heading: INT. MAX’S - MOMENTS LATER
text: The bar is just as busy as it was when we last left it.
dialog: David enters --
text: He places the hat on the back of a chair. Leaves it there.
text: Walks to his table. An almost full bottle of top-shelf
text: tequila sits on it, along with several empty shot glasses.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm taking off.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Already?
text: David's lips form a modest smile.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm giving Emily a ride home.
text: The guys at the table applaud.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: See? And here it is you didn’t
dialog: even want to come tonight.
text: David smirks. Puts on his winter jacket.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’1ll see you guys on Monday.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Alright, playboy.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Congrats.
text: David's about to leave the table. He notices that Corey has
text: put on his own jacket, which is half soaked from when he
dialog: spilt the drinks.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: (patting down his jacket)
dialog: Damn.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Corey puts his jacket over his arm instead.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: What do you mean, what am I doing?
dialog: We're leaving.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, I’m leaving...
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Yeah. And you’re my ride home.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Can’t you take a cab?
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: I don’t have any more cash on me.
text: Slightly frustrated, David takes out his own wallet. He
dialog: doesn’t have much cash either.
speaker_heading: COREY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll just go with you now.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I told you, I’m bringing Emily
dialog: home.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: I know. Just drop me off on the
dialog: way.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Corey...
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: It’ll take ten minutes.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You live twenty minutes away.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: What am I supposed to do -- walk?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Okay. Let’s go.
dialog: 15.
text: Corey swipes the bottle of tequila off the table and hides it
text: under his jacket.
text: Off the guys’ chagrined looks:
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What? I’m the one who bought it.
text: David walks away, toward the exit, with Corey following close
dialog: behind.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - LATER
text: A long stretch of darkened, suburban road, lit by the
text: occasional street light.
text: Small, snow-capped homes appear sporadically. The chilled
text: limbs of wintry trees spread like spindly, bony fingers,
text: hovering just above the road.
text: A set of headlights cut through the darkness.
scene_heading: INT. CAR -— CONTINUOUS
text: David drives as Emily rides in the passenger seat, doing her
text: best to warm her hands near the dashboard vents.
text: She stares out the window, watching the dark world outside
text: speed past her.
text: Corey sits in the backseat, his bottle of tequila in hand.
text: He sips from it as he talks, unnecessarily loudly, on a cell
dialog: phone.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Check my seat. Nothing? How about
dialog: under the table? Yeah. Yeah, it’s
dialog: an iPhone. Nice. Leave it on my
dialog: desk tomorrow. Luke? Leave
dialog: it...you there? Yo?
text: Corey looks at the cell phone. It’s powered down.
speaker_heading: COREY (CONT'D)
dialog: (to David, re: the phone)
dialog: Your battery’s dead.
text: David plugs his car charger into the cigarette lighter.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (re: the cell phone)
dialog: Let me see it.
dialog: 16.
text: David reaches his hand behind him, but Corey throws the phone
text: over David’s shoulder, onto the front seat. It lands on the
text: floor, in a small crevice on the side of the seat.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Dude...?
text: David reaches for the phone, but his hand doesn’t fit. He
text: gives up. Leaves it there.
text: They continue driving. David looks over at Emily, who keeps
text: her hands pressed against the heating vents. He slides off
text: his jacket.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (placing the jacket over
dialog: her lap like a blanket)
dialog: Here.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m sorry by the way.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I realize this is out of the way...
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: It's fine. Honestly.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I’m enjoying the company.
text: David and Emily share a flirtatious smirk.
text: From the backseat, loudly:
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: It’s true, I am good company. Take
dialog: this left.
text: Corey tells David to take the turn just as he reaches the
text: street. David swerves slightly, but readjusts.
speaker_heading: COREY (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t worry about it. You can take
dialog: the next one.
text: David continues driving.
dialog: 17.
text: After a beat:
speaker_heading: COREY (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m starving.
text: No response. Corey tries again.
speaker_heading: COREY (CONT'D)
dialog: You know what I’m saying?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah, that you’re hungry. I get
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Let’s grab something to eat.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: It's after midnight.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: And? What am I, a fuckin’ gremlin?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Yes.
text: David smirks.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Eat at home.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: I don’t have anything. C’mon, just
dialog: stop somewhere.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Nothing’s open.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: There’s a pizza place near here
dialog: that serves slices till two.
text: Corey's clearly too drunk to be getting the hint. David
text: tries a more direct approach.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I kind of want to, you know, bring
dialog: Emily home...
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: It’ll take two seconds. I swear,
dialog: I'll stop this masterclass in cock-
dialog: blocking right after that.
dialog: 18.
text: David looks at Emily. She laughs. David ends up doing the
dialog: same.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You're killing me right now.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Cool. Oh yeah, I need to stop at
text: an ATM.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Just use your debit card.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: They only take cash...unless you
dialog: wanna’ spot me --—
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Where’s the ATM?
scene_heading: EXT. SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER
text: Large and dark, the lot is a vast expanse of empty area.
text: Yellow lines demarcate the hundreds of parking spaces, though
text: none are occupied.
dialog: It’s quite barren. Eerie. Not the best part of town,
dialog: either.
text: The supermarket is closed for the night. A long, frozen,
text: industrial hose snakes from the building to the rows of
text: Douglas-fir trees lined near its entrance.
text: The trees’ chilled limbs dance in the strong winds.
text: Festooned above them, a large banner reads: “CHRISTMAS TREES
dialog: FOR SALE.”
text: Nearby, beneath the supermarket’s main sign, is a large time
dialog: and temperature sign. Current time: 1:18am. Temperature:
dialog: negative 3 degrees Fahrenheit.
text: Across from the supermarket, in a remote area of the parking
text: lot, sits a standalone ATM vestibule owned by BANK OF THE
text: MIDWEST. The large, glass-encased ATM vestibule remains open
dialog: for 24-hour use.
text: David's car pulls up near the ATM vestibule. Not far, but
dialog: not exactly close, either.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER
text: Emily opens her door. lLeans her seat forward. Corey
text: squeezes through, squashing Emily in the process.
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: I’ll be back in a second.
text: Leaving his damp jacket in the car, Corey hurries over to the
dialog: entrance.
text: The ATM vestibule shines like a beacon in the otherwise
text: darkened parking lot. Its many windows are partially frosted
dialog: from the extreme cold.
text: Corey takes a long pull from the bottle of tequila he brings
dialog: with him.
text: David and Emily watch from the car as Corey inserts his ATM
text: card into the outside security reader. He pulls open the door
text: and he enters. Neither says a word at first. Silence, save
text: for the idling engine and the steady sound of heat escaping
text: the vents.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I‘1ll make sure he’s fast at the
dialog: pizza place...
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I really don’t mind.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: They actually make pretty decent
dialog: pizza. The mushroom and, um, and
dialog: something...garlic, I think, is
dialog: pretty good. They cook it all up
dialog: and stuff. It’s good.
text: Off David’s stammering:
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I thought I was the nervous one.
text: David jokingly puffs up.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What are you talking about? I’m
dialog: not nervous.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Catch you later?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well that was -- okay, I was a
dialog: little nervous then, but...
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I like it. It’s cute.
dialog: 20.
text: Emily smiles. She notices a pewter clip -- featuring Saint
text: Christopher -- attached to David’s visor.
speaker_heading: EMILY (CONT'D)
dialog: (re: the clip)
dialog: What’s that?
text: David seems slightly embarrassed.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, it’s nothing.
text: Emily leans in and reads the inscription. Her shoulder
text: touches David’s. Her touch electrifies him.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: “Protect me and my passengers and
text: all who pass by with a steady hand
dialog: and a watchful eye.”
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It’s stupid. I don’t know why I
dialog: even have it.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I think it’s nice. There’s nothing
dialog: wrong with having a little faith.
text: Their conversation is interrupted by the distant sight of
text: Corey in the ATM vestibule. It’s clear by his body language
text: that he’s aggravated about something.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: (re: Corey)
dialog: Uggg...what is it now?
text: Corey turns to face them. Throws his hands up in resigned
dialog: defeat.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: You've got to be kidding me.
text: David gets out of the car. Leaves his jacket behind on
text: Emily's lap. Jogs over to the ATM vestibule.
text: WE STAY ON EMILY as she watches David using his own ATM card
text: to let himself into the vestibule. He and Corey have a brief
text: discussion, ending with David’s obvious displeasure.
text: Emily looks around while holding her cold hands closer to the
text: heat. The emptiness and dark surroundings make her visibly
dialog: uneasy.
dialog: 21.
text: After a moment, she turns off the car. Removes the keys from
text: the ignition. Still wearing her coat, she exits the car and
text: hurries over the ATM. WE SEE that she left behind her purse.
text: Corey opens the door and lets her into...
scene_heading: INT. ATM VESTIBULE - CONTINUOUS
text: Large, both in length and height, the vestibule is quite
text: roomy inside. Close to fifteen feet across. Thirteen feet
text: high ceilings.
text: Glass windows cover three sides of the rectangle shaped
text: vestibule. Its fourth side is a dull, white plaster wall,
text: cluttered with Bank of the Midwest advertisements. Off to
text: one side of this wall is an Automated Teller Machine (ATM).
text: David stands at the ATM, going through the process of getting
dialog: cash.
text: INSERT - The P.O.V. from the silent, black and white video
text: camera situated in the ATM:
text: David, with Emily and Corey in the background, stands in
text: front of the ATM. He punches in his PIN.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: (to Emily)
dialog: What’s wrong?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Nothing. I didn’t want to wait in
dialog: the car.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I‘1l just be a second.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: (to David)
dialog: Why are you taking out money?
text: David rolls his eyes over in Corey’s direction. Corey
dialog: notices.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Cockhead, I’1l pay you back.
dialog: (to Emily, kinder)
dialog: The magnetic strip on my card’s
dialog: messed up.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Cockhead?
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Just a little pet name I have for
dialog: him.
text: Emily chuckles. Corey, who left his coat in the car, blows
text: into his hands for warmth.
speaker_heading: COREY (CONT'D)
dialog: It's freakin’ freezing in here.
text: Emily agrees with a nod. Corey places his cold hands against
text: a small heating vent located along the bottom of the plaster
text: wall. It offers a small amount of relief.
text: Transaction complete. David takes his cash. Grabs his
text: receipt. Throws it in a waste basket.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: All set, let’s go.
text: Leading the way, Emily places her hand on the vestibule door -
text: - on the EXIT LEVER. She’s about to press the lever and open
dialog: the door, when suddenly --
dialog: -- she stops.
text: Corey and David look at her.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: What?
text: She doesn’t move. Not a muscle. Her eyes are fixed on
text: something straight ahead in the dark parking lot.
text: Corey and David turn their attention to what she stares at.
text: Standing there, about thirty feet from the door, is a MAN. A
text: formidably sized man, at that. Shrouded in darkness, wearing
text: a heavy, hooded parka.
text: He doesn’t move -- he simply stands and stares.
text: WE CANNOT SEE his face, only the faint wisps of steam as they
text: curl from his mouth in the cold winter air.
text: David, Emily and Corey stop dead in their tracks. They never
text: exit the vestibule.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Who the hell is that?
text: David looks at his own hand, which is full of cash.
text: Practically on display.
dialog: 23.
text: He quickly stuffs the cash into his pocket.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Who gives a shit? Let’s go.
text: Corey puts his hands on the door, about to open it and exit.
text: David warily grabs Cory by the shirt.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, wait...
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Just wait.
text: Corey stands down. The three of them stare outside at the
dialog: Man.
text: He stares back.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Why’s he out there?
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: He’s probably waiting to use the
speaker_heading: ATM.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Why didn’t he come in, then?
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Who cares? I’m freezing. Let’s
dialog: go.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Damn it, Corey. Wait.
text: Corey stops. Let’s out an annoyed sigh.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: The fucking guy wants to use the
dialog: ATM. Big deal.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Where’s his card?
speaker_heading: COREY
text: Probably in his wallet.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What if he wants to rob us?
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: He’s not here to rob us.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Corey, it’s one in the morning.
dialog: Why would this guy be in the middle
dialog: of an empty parking lot?
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: (re: the ATM)
dialog: The same reason we’re here.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Did we walk here? Alone?
text: Corey looks at the Man for a beat. Considers David's
dialog: assertion.
text: After a beat:
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: This is retarded. I’m leaving.
text: Corey opens the door and starts to exit. The very second he
dialog: does --
text: -- the Man takes a step closer to the ATM vestibule.
text: Seeing this, Corey freezes. After a beat, he then slowly
text: steps back inside the vestibule. Closes the door.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: What was that? Why did he do that?
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Maybe...maybe he thought we were
dialog: done, so he could finally come in.
text: They wait. Continue to look outside at the Man. He does the
text: same right back at them.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Should we call the police?
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: (to David)
dialog: I think we should.
text: David doesn’t respond. He holds his attention on the Man.
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Let’s just ask him why he’s here,
dialog: then.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Corey, no.
text: Corey knocks on the glass. Calls out to the Man.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Hey, buddy. You waiting to use the
speaker_heading: ATM?
text: The Man does not respond. He continues to stand and stare.
text: Unflinchingly.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: (unnerved)
dialog: What does he want, then?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Probably our money.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Does he have anything on him? Can
dialog: you see?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I...I can’t tell.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Are you guys serious right now?
dialog: Who cares about this jerk-off?
dialog: Let's go.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Says the guy who just got scared
text: back into the booth.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Whatever. If we all leave at once,
dialog: we'll be fine. Come on.
text: Corey puts his hands on the door, prepared to exit. David
text: grabs onto him again.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Wait -- will you just wait?!
text: Corey shakes David's grip off of him.
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: For what? I want to go eat.
text: David looks outside. The Man stares back, still standing in
text: the same spot in the parking lot.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: He’s just...watching us.
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: The Man stands and stares at David, Emily and Corey. They
text: stare out at him.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: Emily, David and Corey keep their attention on the Man.
text: Confused. Slightly fearful. Growing colder with each
text: passing minute.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Maybe he’s homeless.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: He probably is. So, give hima fin
dialog: and let’s call it a night.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: He doesn’t look homeless.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: What makes someone not look
dialog: homeless?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: When they’re that big.
text: Just then, the Man’s head WHIPS around. A faint jingling
text: sound grows louder and louder. Someone’s coming.
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: ROBERT, 43, a random man walking his dog, ambles through the
text: parking lot, a hundred feet or so behind the Man. A
text: medallion on his Golden Retriever’s collar jingles with each
dialog: step.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: (to his dog)
dialog: Alright, go ahead.
text: Robert lets go of the dog’s leash. It runs off into the
dialog: dark.
dialog: 27.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: David, Emily and Corey watch as Robert comes into view.
text: The Man walks over to Robert with a determined step.
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: Robert stands and waits for his dog to return. Bounces on
text: the balls of his feet to keep warm.
text: He then notices David, Emily and Corey in the ATM vestibule.
text: They all stand at the door, watching intently. He appears to
dialog: find this somewhat odd.
text: Robert then sees the Man approaching.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: How’s it going?
text: The Man continues toward him. Doesn't say a word.
speaker_heading: ROBERT (CONT'D)
dialog: Just letting my dog do his
dialog: business.
text: The Man continues his approach, undeterred. Robert suddenly
text: appears to feel slightly threatened.
speaker_heading: ROBERT (CONT'D)
dialog: Is there...uh, something I can help
dialog: you --
text: SMASH! Without a moment of hesitation, the Man PUNCHES
text: Robert in the face. Drops him.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE VESTIBULE
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Oh my God!
text: David bangs against the glass, trying to stop the Man.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hey! Hey!!
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: The Man GRABS Robert’s head in his big, meaty hands, wrapped
dialog: in dark leather gloves and --
text: -- SMASH-SMASH!! Against the concrete. Like an animal.
text: Blood trickles out from Robert’s head.
dialog: 28.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE VESTIBULE
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Holy shit. Did you see that? Did
dialog: you see that?!
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: David...
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: The Man removes Robert's wallet from his back pocket.
text: Doesn't open it. Stuffs it into his own jacket pocket.
text: He leaves Robert’s bloodied body in the middle of the parking
dialog: lot. No care. No remorse.
text: He walks back toward the vestibule.
text: Well behind him, Robert’s Golden Retriever returns. Nudges
text: him a few times with his snout. Whimpers. Robert doesn’t
text: move. The dog walks away, its leash dragging behind on the
dialog: ground.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: They watch in horror as the Man returns to where he was
text: originally standing. He plants himself there. As if nothing
dialog: happened.
text: David frantically reaches into his pocket. Searches.
text: Nothing. Reaches into his other pocket. Same result.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Damn it!
dialog: (to Emily and Corey)
dialog: Call nine-one-one. Call them!
text: Corey throws his hands up. He doesn’t have his phone,
text: remember? David looks to Emily.
text: She sheepishly answers.
speaker_heading: EMILY
text: My phone’s in my purse.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Where’s your purse?
text: Emily looks outside.
speaker_heading: EMILY
text: In the car.
dialog: 29.
text: Corey starts frantically looking around next to the ATM.
speaker_heading: COREY
text: (running his fingers along
dialog: the underside of the ATM)
dialog: Don’t they have panic buttons in
dialog: these things?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Yeah they must.
text: They all join in looking for the button, but can’t find it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Shit, what about a hard line?
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don’t know, like an elevator
dialog: phone. A speaker thing that
text: connects directly to the bank.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Right, right.
text: They all continue looking around, but still they find
dialog: nothing.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: This can’t be happening.
text: But it is. The three of them stare at each other, all
dialog: pleading for an idea. They’ve got nothing.
text: The gravity of the situation fully takes hold.
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - LATER
text: Chilling winds scream through the empty lot, knocking one of
text: the Christmas trees over. A small chain, fastened to its
text: trunk, keeps it from blowing away.
text: A few pieces of trash roll about like suburban tumbleweed.
text: The time and temperature sign provides its update. Current
text: time: 1:52am. Temperature: negative 5 degrees Fahrenheit.
text: The ATM vestibule sits in the distance, aglow in the dark
dialog: winter night.
dialog: 30.
scene_heading: INT. ATM VESTIBULE - CONTINUOUS
text: David paces back and forth, futilely hugging his arms close
text: to his body for warmth.
text: Corey kneels near the wall, his hands near the heating vent.
text: He takes a warming sip from the bottle of tequila.
text: Emily clenches her jacket closed as she stares into the
text: parking lot. Her teeth chatter behind her dry, pallid lips.
text: She can’t take her frightened eyes off the Man, who slowly
text: circles the vestibule like a shark. A predator.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: There has to be something.
dialog: Something we can do to, I don’t
dialog: know, get someone’s attention.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Who? There’s no one else out
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: There was that guy with his dog.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: And look what happened to him.
dialog: David takes this into account.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: (re: the Man)
dialog: Why hasn’t he come in here?
text: Corey and David look outside at the Man. Study him as they
dialog: talk to each other.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Maybe he doesn’t have an ATM card.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Why would that stop him?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You need it for the buzzer thing.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: What if the dog guy has one?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Has he checked?
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: How the fuck should I know?
text: Their concern escalates.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: What are we going to do?
text: David looks over at the car. It’s parked a good distance
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Where are my keys?
text: Emily digs into her jacket pocket. Removes David’s keys, as
text: well as a tube of lipstick. She hands David his keys.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Maybe I can get to the car.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: You’1l never make it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You don’t know that.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: David, the guy’s right there.
dialog: You'll be lucky to get within ten
text: feet of it.
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: The Man notices that all three of them look in the direction
text: of the car. It’s obvious what they’re considering.
text: He walks toward the car.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE VESTIBULE
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: What’s he doing?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Shit -- I think he heard us.
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: The Man opens the driver’s side door. Leans in. Fiddles
text: around near the steering wheel, though WE CANNOT SEE what
dialog: he’s doing.
text: He then pushes a button to pop the trunk. Closes the
text: driver’s side door.
dialog: 32.
text: After standing in front of it for a moment -- with his back
text: facing the vestibule -- he then retreats to the back of the
dialog: car.
text: Opens the trunk. A faint light emits from a small bulb. The
text: Man carelessly rummages through the junk inside, throwing
text: much of it to the ground, including an old, folding lawn
dialog: chair.
text: He finds a tire iron, apparently what he was looking for.
text: Grabs it. He then spots a small tool kit. Takes that, too.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: They watch as the Man closes the trunk, carrying the tire
text: iron and tool kit.
text: He walks away from the car, toward the vestibule. Continues
text: walking, until he’s out of sight, presumably behind the
text: vestibule.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Is he leaving?
text: David places his face against where the last pane of glass
text: meets the plaster wall, trying to see the Man.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No...I can’t tell. I think he went
dialog: around back. Shit.
text: David peels away from the window.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: What should we do?
text: They all look at one other. At the car. At the open parking
dialog: lot.
dialog: Decision time.
text: INSERT - The P.O.V. from the silent, black and white security
dialog: camera in the ATM:
text: David, Emily and Corey stand near one another, looking
text: unnerved. Discomposed. Scared.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
text: Still no sign of the Man.
text: Silence, except for the steady hum of the small rotor in the
text: heating vent.
dialog: 33.
text: David's foot lifts from the floor. Slowly. It lands one
text: step closer to the door.
text: He waits a second for a reaction of some kind. But there’s
dialog: none. Has the Man left?
text: As David begins to take another step --
dialog: -- BANG!!
text: The sound of metal striking metal. Coming from the back of
text: the vestibule, behind the plaster wall.
text: David, Emily and Corey WHIP around to face the plaster wall.
text: BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG!! It echoes through the vestibule.
text: Followed by a screeching sound. Metal scraping metal.
text: David waits a beat, and then:
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (to Emily, hushed)
dialog: Your cell phone...you’re positive
dialog: it’s in your purse?
text: Emily nods.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: On the front seat?
text: Corey looks over at David, figuring out what he’s driving at.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: He’s back there. By the time he
dialog: gets around the booth, I’1l be
text: halfway to the car.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: And what about the other half of
dialog: the way?
text: BANG-BANG-BANG!! Even louder this time.
text: Emily, Corey and David watch as the plaster wall rattles
dialog: slightly.
text: Followed only by the continuous hum of the heating vent.
text: And then the faint sound of what sounds like a metal object
text: being dropped onto the ground is heard.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: (hushed)
text: He has a gun.
text: David shakes his head.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: He would have shot at us by now.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: This glass is probably bullet-
dialog: proof.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, it’s not.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: We should just wait. It’1ll be light
dialog: out soon. This parking lot will be
text: filled with people.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: The sun won't be up for hours.
dialog: We'll be lucky if we don’t freeze
dialog: to death before then.
dialog: 34.
text: David's right. The clouds of breath that escape his mouth
dialog: are proof of this.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: This is fucking insane.
text: Corey rests his head against the glass. Defeated.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: (pleading with her eyes)
dialog: It’s too dangerous.
text: David meets Emily’s heartfelt stare. His adrenaline is
text: momentarily stifled as he considers what to do.
dialog: And then --
scene_heading: -- POOF-POOF-POOF...
text: The overhead fluorescent lights blow out in succession.
text: vestibule turns almost pitch black inside, save for the
text: of the ATM display screen.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Terrific.
text: After a few short BEEPS, the emergency lights kick in.
dialog: The
dialog: light
dialog: They
text: are not nearly as bright. The vestibule remains quite dark.
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: What the hell was that? What
dialog: happened?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: He cut the power.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Oh no.
text: David and Corey turn to see what concerns Emily. She’s
text: crouched down near the heating vent.
text: It’s silent.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: No...no, no...
text: Corey bangs the bottom of his fist against the vent.
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: COREY (CONT'D)
dialog: shit.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: He’s back.
text: Corey lifts his head. Sees that the Man is back in view. He
text: stands about fifteen feet from the vestibule.
text: And then, something occurs to David.
text: Looking at the glass window pane --
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Wait...wait-wait-wait...
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: What is it?
text: Without explanation, David suddenly bangs against the frosty
text: windows several times. Hard. But the glass shows no sign of
dialog: compromise.
speaker_heading: EMILY (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you doing?!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: The glass -- there’s got to be an
dialog: alarm on it or something.
text: David bangs harder, all to no avail.
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: But if you break it, he’ll be able
dialog: to get in.
dialog: She's got a point.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: All right...then something else.
text: David looks around the vestibule. His eyes lock on the
text: plaster wall.
text: He KICKS at it. Repeatedly. Frantically.
text: It dents. Deforms.
text: Cory joins in. SMASHES his shoulder into the plaster wall,
text: over and over again.
text: Pieces of drywall fall to the ground. But still, no alarm.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Damn it!!
text: Emily's eyes drift upward. Something catches her attention.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Wait...
text: David and Corey stop.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Those will have an alarm.
text: David looks up to where Emily stares. He sees what she sees:
text: the emergency fire sprinklers.
speaker_heading: EMILY (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you have a lighter?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Shit. No.
dialog: (to Corey)
dialog: You?
text: Corey shakes his head “No.”
text: Out of breath, David looks at the ATM itself. Without any
text: hesitation, he storms over to it.
text: WHAM!! He delivers a KICK right at it. Nothing.
dialog: 37.
text: INSERT - The ATM's silent, black and white security camera
speaker_heading: P.O.V.:
text: David repeatedly KICKS the ATM.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: The Man watches the chaos from the shadows.
text: David finally gives up. Corey does the same. They fight to
dialog: catch their breath.
text: Slightly muffled by the glass:
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Come on!!!
scene_heading: INSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: David is at a loss. Still laboring to catch his breath in
text: the cold air, he slowly approaches the glass. Sees something
text: in the distance. His eyes widen.
text: He bangs the glass. Yells out.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hey! Hey!! Over here!!
text: Emily and Corey see what David is looking at: a car -- with
text: emergency lights on its roof. It has just pulled into the
text: distant entrance of the parking lot.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: It’s the cops.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Hey!! Help us!!
text: But, the car circles back around, never coming close to the
dialog: bank.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Come back! Please!!
text: The car’s taillights disappear into the night, behind the
text: cover of white cloud exhaust. It’s too late -- it’s gone.
text: None of them have a clue what to do next.
dialog: 38.
text: After a beat:
speaker_heading: EMILY (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m so cold.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Me too.
text: Emily paces to the other side of the vestibule. Shivers.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Corey)
dialog: How much do you have in your
dialog: account?
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: I’m not sure. Why?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’ve got close to three grand.
text: David approaches the ATM. Inserts his card. Punches
dialog: buttons.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: You're not going to give this
dialog: asshole money?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: He just fucking beat a guy to
dialog: death, Corey. If it means us
dialog: getting out of here alive,
dialog: absolutely.
dialog: Something’s wrong.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Damn...
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (re: the ATM)
dialog: It‘ll only let me take out four
dialog: hundred.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I already took out a hundred.
dialog: There’s a daily limit.
dialog: 39.
text: David goes forward with the withdrawal anyway.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Corey)
dialog: You take out five hundred, too.
dialog: Maybe a thousand will be enough.
text: David grabs his cash. Takes back his ATM card.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: I told you, my card’s not working.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Shit. That’s right.
text: David gives Corey a once-over. Notices his watch.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What about that?
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Your watch.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: No fucking way am I giving this to
dialog: him.
text: Emily takes off her diamond stud earrings.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Here. Take these.
text: David looks down at the earrings. After a beat he
text: reluctantly takes them.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (to Corey)
dialog: It’s just a watch, Corey.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: The thing’s been in my family
dialog: forever. I can’t...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Look, I know it’s important to you,
dialog: but...we need it.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: No. I’m not doing it.
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You’re unbelievable.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Fine, I’m unbelievable.
text: David gives up. Stares at the cash and earrings he holds in
text: hand, clearly questioning if it is going to be enough.
dialog: Now what?
text: Emily huddles her arms close to her body for warmth. She
text: trembles. As she stares outside, almost in a state of
text: catatonia, she has a frightening realization.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: (to Corey)
dialog: Wait...if your card’s not working,
dialog: how did you get in?
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: What do you mean?
text: After a moment, David appears to figure out what Emily’s
text: driving at. He instantly becomes equally concerned.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: She means, if the magnetic strip on
dialog: your card’s messed up, like you
dialog: said it is, how were you able to
dialog: get past the security buzzer?
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Who gives a shit?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Please tell me you were just being
dialog: cheap.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: What?
text: David's panic grows tenfold. His words are pleas for
dialog: comfort.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Your card works fine. You were
dialog: just too cheap to take out money,
dialog: right, Corey?
text: Corey finally gets it, evidenced by his sudden look of
dialog: disquietude.
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Corey...?
text: He slowly shakes his head to say “No.”
text: David and Emily look at each other. Fear stains their faces.
text: David takes slow, trepidant steps over to the vestibule door.
text: He looks at it. Terrified. He slowly extends his trembling
text: hand until his fingertips make contact with the icy glass.
text: Without pressing the EXIT LEVER, he gently, and ever so
text: slightly, pushes the glass door itself --
text: -- and it OPENS. A chilling wind whistles in through the
text: small space.
text: His outstretched hand quivers. The locking mechanism on the
text: door is clearly broken.
text: In short: The door is unlocked.
text: David looks outside for the Man. He’s nowhere in sight. But
dialog: still, did he see this?
text: David nervously pulls back his hand, closing the barely-
text: opened vestibule door.
text: He backs away.
text: After a beat, David signals to Corey. “Give it.”
text: Corey removes his wristwatch. Hands it to David.
text: David approaches a signing shelf, affixed to one of the glass
text: walls of the vestibule. He grabs an ATM deposit envelope.
text: Reaching into his pocket, he removes all his cash. Stuffs it
text: into the envelope. Same for Corey’s watch and Emily’s
text: earrings.
text: Seals the envelope. His cold, shaking hands make these fine
dialog: movements difficult.
text: David signals Emily and Corey over. They huddle around him.
text: He holds the deposit envelope in hand.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’m going to slide this to the side
text: of him -- away from the door. If
dialog: he goes for it, we run the other
text: way, toward the main road.
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Yeah. Okay.
text: It's apparent that Emily is less confident in the plan.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (to Emily)
dialog: What’s wrong?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: What if there are more of them out
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: More of what?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Him.
text: Emily looks outside for the Man.
speaker_heading: EMILY (CONT'D)
dialog: How do we know he’s alone?
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: The Man stands at the rear of the vestibule, out of their
dialog: sight.
text: The tool box the Man removed earlier from David’s trunk is on
text: the ground. Its cover open, WE SEE a spool of wire amongst
dialog: its contents.
text: In front of him is a steel door, encased by a brick wall,
text: that appears to lead inside the vestibule. He tries to pry
text: open the door with the tire iron. No luck. He then picks up
text: a screwdriver in one hand and a hammer in the other.
text: The Man places the screwdriver to the already damaged lock.
text: He is about to strike the end of the screwdriver with the
text: hammer when he overhears Corey, David and Emily OFF-SCREEN.
text: He stops. Listens. It’s difficult to hear them, but it
text: sounds as though they’re having a disagreement over
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: DAVID (0.S.)
dialog: Emily’s right, it’s too risky.
speaker_heading: COREY (0.S.)
dialog: There’s no one else out there.
speaker_heading: EMILY (0.S.)
dialog: You don’t know that.
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: COREY (0.S.)
dialog: Neither do you!
speaker_heading: DAVID (0.S.)
dialog: I’1l go alone.
speaker_heading: EMILY (0.S.)
dialog: No, David.
speaker_heading: COREY (0.S.)
dialog: You're not stranding us here.
speaker_heading: DAVID (0.S.)
dialog: I’m not stranding anybody. If I
dialog: make it to the car, I can go get
dialog: help.
text: The Man quietly places the tools on the ground. Walks to the
text: side of the brick wall. Peers around it. Waits.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: INSERT - P.O.V. from the black and white security camera,
text: situated inside the ATM. The image is slightly obscured,
dialog: caused earlier when David smashed the ATM with his foot:
text: With the deposit envelope in hand, David slowly approaches
text: the door. Corey and Emily stand close behind him.
text: The security camera image only captures the inside of the
text: vestibule, but only a few feet outside.
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: David opens the door. Halfway. Seconds later, he takes a
text: single step outside. He is hit by a blast of arctic air.
text: His button-down, collared shirt does little to keep him warm.
text: The Man slowly emerges from behind the vestibule. Ready.
text: David takes a second step outside. He turns around to face
dialog: Corey and Emily.
text: David signals them with an apprehensive nod. They respond as
text: they're clearly supposed to -- by closing the door behind
dialog: him.
text: For the first time since all this started, David is outside
text: the vestibule. Alone. Vulnerable.
text: He looks around. Nervous. Scared. No sign of the Man.
dialog: 44,
text: And then, from out of the shadows, he emerges. Standing
text: approximately twenty feet in front of David, his heavy
text: breaths escape from the hood of his parka.
text: David holds out the envelope.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: There’s...there’s five hundred
dialog: dollars in here...plus, everything
dialog: we have. A pair of earrings, a
dialog: watch. It’s yours, all of it.
dialog: Please...just let us go.
text: The Man doesn’t react. He just continues to stare.
text: Corey and Emily watch, nervously, from behind the glass.
text: The bitter cold stings David’s cheeks, transforming his
text: breath into vapor.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: We won’t tell the police about any
dialog: of this. We’ve never even seen
dialog: your face, so...so you can just
dialog: take this...
text: David slides the envelope full of valuables across the
text: concrete, off to the side -- away from the door.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: .»-and...you know, disappear. Like
dialog: nothing happened. Okay? Is
dialog: that...is that okay?
text: The Man is yet to move. Silence. The tension is palpable.
text: And then, after a long beat --
text: -- the Man takes a step in the direction the envelope.
text: Finally, a glimmer of hope.
text: Step by lumbering step, the Man gets closer to the envelope --
text: and further away from David. And the car.
text: David surreptitiously removes his car keys from his pocket.
text: Waits the for the right moment to make his move.
dialog: Waits...
dialog: Waits......
dialog: Waits........
dialog: 45.
dialog: Now!
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: sprints across the parking lot, toward the car.
speaker_heading: THE MAN
text: sees him and gives up entirely on the envelope. Walks, quite
text: resolutely, toward David.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: reaches the car. Pulls on the door handle. It’s locked. He
text: immediately clicks the unlock button on the key, but it
dialog: remains locked --
text: -- He looks down to see the lock is jammed with something.
text: The pewter visor clip of St. Christopher.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Shit!
scene_heading: INSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: Corey bangs on the glass. Emily yells out, frantically.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: He’s coming!!
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: looks through the car window at the passenger side. That
text: door is unlocked. He turns around to check on...
speaker_heading: THE MAN,
text: who is almost on him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: runs around the car. Reaches the passenger side. Yanks at
dialog: the door --
text: -- it opens. Relief. Momentary.
speaker_heading: THE MAN
text: rounds the front of the car.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: 46.
text: leaps inside. Slides over to the driver's side. Inserts the
text: key into the ignition. Turns it --
text: -- Click. Nothing. A broken panel exposes torn wires
text: hanging from the ignition.
speaker_heading: THE MAN
text: gets within feet of the passenger side door.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: locks the passenger side door.
text: He then spots Emily’s purse on the floor. He hurriedly
text: rummages through it. Finds her cell phone. Dials 9-1-1. Is
dialog: just abut to press SEND, when --
dialog: -- SMASH!!!
speaker_heading: THE MAN
text: punches through the passenger side window with his gloved
text: hand. Lunges for David.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: leaps to the driver’s seat. Opens the door. Is about to
dialog: escape when --
speaker_heading: THE MAN
text: unlocks the passenger side door. Violently swings it open.
text: Catches hold of David by the neck. Yanks him out of the car
text: in a single pull. His strength is impossible.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: falls from the car, landing hard on the cold concrete with a
text: wind-stealing thud. Emily’s cell phone falls from his hand
text: and slides well out of reach.
speaker_heading: COREY
text: jumps out of the vestibule, keeping one hand on the open
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: David
speaker_heading: THE MAN
text: looks over at Corey, momentarily turning his attention away
dialog: from David.
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: uses this distraction to climb back into the car. The
text: already open driver’s side door is his only chance. He
text: frantically scurries across the front seat.
speaker_heading: THE MAN
text: reaches in the car after David. Gets a hold of his shirt.
text: Pulls hard.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: sheds his ripping dress shirt, leaving him in a T-shirt and
text: freeing himself from the Man’s powerful grip. He falls out
text: of the driver’s side door. Struggles to get to his feet --
text: he’s banged-up pretty badly.
speaker_heading: COREY
text: reaches his hand out, trying to hurry David along.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Hurry!!
text: Emily joins Cory outside the vestibule door.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: David, run!!!
speaker_heading: THE MAN
text: walks to the front of the car. Closes in on David.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: staggers toward the vestibule. Notices the cell phone. 911
text: shines brightly on the display, waiting for the Send button
dialog: to be pressed.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Hurry!!
text: David stops. He’s about to change course and go for the
dialog: phone.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: David -- no!!
speaker_heading: THE MAN
text: gets to within eight feet of David.
dialog: Five feet...
dialog: 48.
dialog: Three feet...
dialog: He’s right on him...
text: He’s just about to grab him, when...
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: is forced to abandon the phone. He changes his course back
text: toward the vestibule. He outstretches his hand, fighting
text: through the pain.
text: Just as the Man is about to latch onto him --
speaker_heading: COREY
text: leans forward and connects with David’s hand. He YANKS David
text: in. Hard. Pulling him...
scene_heading: INSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: Corey and Emily SLAM the door shut and hold it closed. Grip
text: the handle with all their might.
text: David falls to the floor, holding his ribs. Coughing.
text: Bleeding.
text: After a moment of obvious surprise, Emily and Corey release
text: their grip on the door.
text: WE SEE that the Man has discontinued his pursuit. Just over
text: ten feet from the vestibule door.
text: Emily drops to her knees, next to David. Comes to his aid.
text: Takes off her jacket and wraps David in it, leaving her in a
text: thin blouse.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: David! David! Are you okay?
text: David labors to get his breath back.
text: Corey watches as the Man walks away from the vestibule, into
text: the darkness. Once Corey knows it’s safe, he joins Emily at
dialog: David's side.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: You all right?
text: David coughs. His breath clouds in the cold air. He
text: struggles to regain his faculties.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah...
dialog: 49.
text: David hands Emily back her jacket.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Here.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: You need it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: So do you.
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: The Man picks up Emily’s cell phone. He then walks over to
text: the discarded deposit envelope. Picks that up as well.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: They watch as the Man approaches David’s car. Circles around
text: to the trunk.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: What’s he doing?
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: The Man reaches into his jacket pocket and removes Robert's
text: wallet. Tosses it inside the trunk.
text: He then throws the deposit envelope and Emily’s cell phone
text: into the trunk. 911 on the phone’s display screen, still
dialog: having never been Sent.
text: He SLAMS the trunk shut.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: They watch the Man.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: Shit...
text: Corey leans against the glass. Slides down to the floor.
text: Mentally and physically spent.
text: David and Emily are already seated on the floor. They, too,
dialog: have reached their limits.
text: The three of them look at one another from across the
text: vestibule. Shiver uncontrollably. Their faces ashen with
dialog: grief.
text: No one seems to know what to say. Silence is appropriate.
dialog: 50.
text: Emily stuffs her hands into her jacket pockets for warmth.
text: Finds something -- her tube of lipstick. She uncaps it and
text: approaches the window. Writes something on the glass.
text: David and Corey watch her.
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: The dim emergency lights appear bright when set against the
text: dark night.
text: Written in large, lipstick letters on the glass: “HELP”
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
scene_heading: INT. ATM VESTIBULE - LATER
text: INSERT - P.O.V. from the silent, black and white security
dialog: camera in the ATM:
text: David and Corey PULL on the small metal grate covering the
text: heating vent. KICK at it. Emily watches with hope.
text: Her lipstick message falls just outside the camera’s line of
dialog: sight.
speaker_heading: END INSERT
text: Try as David and Corey might, the metal grate’s not budging.
text: Not a chance. They give up.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Son of a bitch.
text: Their speech has begun to thicken. They exhibit signs of
text: cognitive decline. Shiver uncontrollably. Appear slightly
dialog: confused.
text: Early signs of hypothermia.
text: David looks closer at the vent. Examines it. Stares inside
text: with a mini key ring flashlight.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: What do you see?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: There’s a...a room or something.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: A room?
text: David blows into his numb hands in efforts to warm them.
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah. It’s small. It must be
text: where they go to restock the ATM.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: If there’s a room, that means
dialog: there’s a door.
text: Corey kneels down next to him. Looks inside the small vent.
speaker_heading: COREY (CONT'D)
dialog: If we distract him, Emily can use
text: it to sneak out back.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (re: the vent)
dialog: There’s no way she’s fitting
dialog: through this.
text: David's right. The vent is far too small.
text: Corey looks up at the cracks and dents made earlier in the
text: plaster wall. Digs his fingers in. Pulls. His tired,
text: frozen muscles keep him from mustering up any real strength.
text: Finally, a sizeable chunk of drywall falls to the floor,
text: exposing a brick wall behind it.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Son of a bitch.
text: Emily looks over at the ATM.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: (to David)
dialog: Let me see your card.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I took out as much as I could.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I know.
text: Her hand stays outstretched. David hands it to her.
text: She inserts it into the ATM card slot. Looks to David. It
text: takes him a second to realize what she’s waiting for.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Five, nine, oh-eight.
text: Emily removes a pen from her coat pocket. Says the PIN out
text: loud as she writes it on the back of a deposit envelope.
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Five...nine...zero...eight.
dialog: Okay...
text: She presses numbers on the ATM keypad. In reverse order of
dialog: what she wrote down.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Eight...zero...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You're doing it backwards.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I know. I remember hearing that if
dialog: you enter a pin backwards into an
text: ATM, it automatically alerts the
dialog: police. It’s some sort of panic
dialog: code in case you're getting robbed.
text: David joins Emily at the ATM. Corey stays down near the
text: heating vent, shining the mini key ring flashlight inside.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: That’s an urban legend. It’s
dialog: bullshit.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (to Corey)
dialog: How do you know that?
text: Corey turns off the flashlight. Stuffs the keys in his pants
dialog: pocket.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Think about it -- what if your pin
dialog: was, like, four, two, two, four?
dialog: You're fucked.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: It’s still worth trying.
text: Emily enters the last of the digits. Presses ENTER.
text: The display screen reads: “INCORRECT PIN.” David’s card is
text: ejected from the card slot. A steady BEEP sounds from the
text: ATM, alerting them to remove the card.
text: David is about to retrieve his card when he is distracted by
text: Corey, who climbs to his feet, facing the door.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Where did he go?
dialog: 53.
text: David and Emily turn around to see what Corey is looking at:
text: No one. The Man is missing. Robert's body, however, remains
dialog: where it was last seen.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Did you see him leave?
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: I just turned around and he wasn’t
dialog: there anymore.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: But did you actually see him walk
dialog: away?
text: David presses his face against the glass. His dilated eyes
text: frenetically dart in every direction.
text: The ATM continues to beep, signaling the need for the card to
text: be retrieved from the slot.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Who cares? This might be our only
dialog: chance.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: He could be right around back.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Even if he is, we’re less safe in
dialog: here than we are out there.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We're still alive.
dialog: (re: Robert)
dialog: He’s not.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: That doesn’t mean shit.
text: Corey puts his hands on the door, prepared to exit.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Corey, please, no.
text: He stops. Disarmed by Emily’s genuine concern for him.
speaker_heading: EMILY (CONT'D)
dialog: Please...
text: He takes his hands off the door. Calms down.
text: After a beat:
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: If he wants to get in here, he can.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: He doesn’t know that.
speaker_heading: COREY
text: He doesn’t have to use the door.
text: He can smash the glass with a rock.
dialog: He can drive the damn car right at
dialog: us...
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Then why hasn’t he?
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: I don’t know. I don’t know...
text: The ATM finally stops beeping. David’s card is swallowed.
text: David taps a few buttons on the ATM. Nothing. His card is
dialog: gone.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Shit...
text: Emily continues to stare out the windows. With her eyes
dialog: fixed outside:
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Why's he doing this to us?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Maybe we did something to him.
dialog: But what? David obviously has no idea.
speaker_heading: EMILY (CONT'D)
dialog: Did something happen at the bar?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Not with me.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Me either.
dialog: (beat, then to David)
dialog: Wait...what about that guy from
dialog: work today?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What guy?
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: The one screaming at you on the
dialog: phone.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: What did you do to him?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Bullshit, nothing. You lost half
dialog: the money in his 401K three days
dialog: before Christmas.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah, I know, but...
dialog: (re: the Man)
dialog: This guy isn’t him.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Because I know.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: You said it yourself. You’ve never
dialog: met him in person.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, but I do know he’s in his
dialog: sixties. If anything, this guy
dialog: could be any one of the thousands
dialog: of people you piss off daily.
text: Emily’s not convinced.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Emily, this guy isn’t doing all
dialog: this because I lost his money. If
dialog: that were the case, why would he
dialog: kill the dog guy? It doesn’t make
dialog: sense.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: It’s at least a reason.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: But why here? Why not do this in
dialog: some alley or wherever, where there
dialog: isn’t glass separating us, or a
dialog: security camera watching?
dialog: 56.
text: David looks around the vestibule. Thinks as he speaks.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: It’s isolated. Open all night.
dialog: Only one way in or out. And
text: there’s a box full of money in it.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It’s the perfect human trap.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Human trap! Are you hearing
dialog: yourself right now?
dialog: David shrugs, any other ideas?
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: So what, he was waiting here?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don’t know. It’s possible, maybe.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: He couldn’t have followed us. We
dialog: didn’t see any cars.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Right, yes. So he was waiting.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: But how did he know we'd be here?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: He didn’t.
text: Corey shakes his head.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Fuck that, this is all bullshit.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: That’s great man. Really fucking
dialog: insightful.
text: They all try to calm their nerves a bit.
text: None of them can stop from shivering. The cold is
dialog: oppressive.
text: After a long beat:
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: I can’t feel my fingers.
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Me either.
text: Emily extends her pale hands to get a better look at them.
text: Her fingertips are slightly purple.
text: David cups Emily’s hands in his. Rubs them.
text: In a much needed moment of levity, David grabs Corey’s hands,
text: too. Huddles them together with his and Emily's.
text: But, the moment is fleeting. Somber looks soon appear on
text: their faces. Their trembling hands lower and separate.
text: Their eyes divert.
text: They're freezing to death. They clearly know it, too.
text: Just then, a faint light shines across the parking lot, near
text: the supermarket. David, Corey and Emily turn to face it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What’s that?
text: Seconds later, its source appears: the same car from earlier.
text: Unlit emergency lights sit on its roof.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: It’s the police. The same one from
dialog: before.
text: Emily bangs against the class.
speaker_heading: EMILY (CONT'D)
dialog: Help!! HELP US!!
text: David and Corey join in, basically yelling the same.
scene_heading: INT. SECURITY CAR - CONTINUOUS
text: A slightly overweight SECURITY GUARD, 45, drives his car
text: through the parking lot. A late-night AM talk show plays on
dialog: his radio.
text: He notices David, Emily and Corey across the parking lot in
text: the bank vestibule.
text: Confounded, he circles around.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS
text: INSERT - The Man's P.O.V.: the car approaches. He watches it

speaker_heading: END INSERT
dialog: 58.
text: The Security car pulls up closer to the vestibule.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: They watch as the car draws nearer.
text: Corey is ready to burst out the door. Emily and David stand
text: behind him, also ready.
speaker_heading: COREY
text: As soon as the cop sees us, we make
dialog: a run for it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah. Okay.
text: But then -- the car’s overhead emergency lights are switched
text: on. Not red and blue. Green.
text: Corey stops. Apparently thinks better of exiting.
speaker_heading: COREY
text: It’s a security guard.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: So what?
text: The Security car parks. Its green lights continue to spin.
text: From out of it emerges the Security Guard.
speaker_heading: COREY
text: So he doesn’t have a gun. He’s not
dialog: going to be able to do shit to stop
dialog: that guy.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (re: the Man)
dialog: Where is he?
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: I don’t know. I still don’t see
dialog: him.
text: Emily bangs on the glass.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Help us!!
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: The Security Guard walks toward the vestibule. Cautiously.
text: The spinning green light reflects off his shiny, brass badge.
dialog: 59.
text: He notices the residue of the word “HELP” written on the
text: glass, which is now faded and indiscernible.
text: He removes a MAGLITE FLASHLIGHT from his garrison belt, next
text: to a can of PEPPER SPRAY.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: What are you guys doing in there?
text: Muffled through the glass:
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Watch out -- there’s someone out
dialog: there.
text: Emily opens the door enough to lean outside.
text: The Midwestern wind howls madly.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Call the police!
text: The Security Guard cannot hear her over the wind.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: What? I can’t...
text: He walks closer. Trepidation in each step.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD (CONT’D)
dialog: Are you okay in there?
text: Still fighting the wind, but more discernible:
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: He’s trying to kill us!!
text: The Security Guard looks over to where Emily points. All he
text: sees is David’s car.
text: Confused at first, the Security Guard’s expression quickly
text: changes upon seeing Robert’s bloody, dead body lying on the
dialog: concrete.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Jesus...
text: He fumbles with his walkie-talkie. Hurriedly puts it to his
dialog: mouth.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Twenty-two to base, twenty-two to
dialog: base...
dialog: 60.
text: Only STATIC is heard from the other end of the walkie-talkie.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD (CONT’D)
dialog: Twenty-two to base, twenty-two to
dialog: base...
text: A DISPATCHER is heard through the walkie-talkie.
speaker_heading: DISPATCHER (V.O.)
dialog: Go ahead, twenty-two.
dialog: WHAM!!!
text: The Security Guard's head is smashed with a half crumbled
text: CINDER BLOCK. He collapses to the ground. The Man stands over
dialog: him.
text: Seeing this, Emily YANKS the vestibule door shut.
text: The Security Guard is almost unconscious. The man picks up a
text: smaller piece of the now shattered cinder block and SMASH-
text: SMASH. The man slams him in the temple. Blood spills out.
text: Just as suddenly as it started, it stops. The Security Guard
text: doesn’t move.
text: The Man takes a step away, over to the Security car. He
text: turns off the ignition, the lights.
text: The Man then grabs the Security Guard by his shirt. Drags
text: him, using only one of his powerful arms, across the parking
text: lot. Like he’s clearing roadkill.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: David, Emily and Corey watch as the Man drags the Security
text: Guard’s dead, bloodied body closer to David's car. He leaves
text: him there, carelessly, not far from Robert’s carcass.
text: It’s all too much for Emily to take.
text: She walks softly to the corner of the booth. Sits down. Her
text: back facing David and Corey.
text: After a beat:
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Are you okay? Emily?
text: She doesn’t answer.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Emily?
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Leave me alone.
text: David reaches out to touch Emily’s shoulder. She abruptly
text: pulls away.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Both of you, please, just...leave
dialog: me alone.
text: She shivers in the cold. Hugs her arms close to her body.
text: David and Corey speak quietly to each other.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: She needs to keep moving.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I know, I know...
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: We should still make a run for it --
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: No --
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: -- He'll go for one of us, and the
dialog: others can make a run for it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Who's going to play the bait? You?
dialog: Because I’m sure as hell not going
dialog: to again.
text: Corey sighs. Frustrated.
text: Still huddled in the corner:
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Do we have any more plants?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (confused)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Plants...I don’t know. I thought
dialog: there were plants.
text: She rubs her temples. Appears disconcerted.
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: (quietly to David)
text: She's disoriented as fuck.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It’s hypothermia. We can’t stay
dialog: here much longer.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: No shit. We just have --
text: CLICK. A HOWLING wind blows into the vestibule.
text: Their heads WHIP around to face the now open door, where they
dialog: see --
dialog: -- THE MAN WALKING IN!!!
text: Corey's eyes widen.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Emily!!
text: David LUNGES forward, BLOCKING the Man from Emily, who he is
text: nearest. He GRABS the Man by his thick jacket and SLAMS him
text: against the plaster wall.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Abhh..
text: The Man FIGHTS BACK. Resists. Corey immediately JUMPS in
text: the fray. Joins David in WRESTLING the Man to the ground.
text: WHACK-WHACK-WHACK! David and Corey’s PUNCHES land,
text: haphazardly, all over the Man’s face and body. Still he
text: continues to struggle, both audibly and physically.
text: The Man KICKS wildly, STRIKING Corey in the face.
text: Emily screams.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Grab him!!
text: Corey shakes it off. Blood spills from his nose. He JUMPS
text: back on top of the Man, rejoining David in the struggle. He
text: GRABS the Man by the hair, lifts his head --
text: -- SLAM-SLAM-SLAM. Against the wall, just beneath the
text: signing shelf. The Man screams out in pain. Blood stains
text: his hair. Still, he fights back. Grabs at David’s face and
dialog: neck.
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: David!!
text: The Man’s fingers RAKE across David's eyes. PULL at his hair
text: and skin. The entire battle is awkwardly primordial. No
dialog: skill whatsoever; only pure survival instinct.
text: With the Man’s hands now GRABBING at his throat, David
text: notices the pen -- hanging from a thin, steel cable wire
text: attached to the signing shelf above -- dangling in front of
dialog: him.
text: His eyes widen.
text: He frees one of his hands, which is tangled up in the
text: struggle. Grabs the pen. Wraps the steel wire around the
text: Man's throat. Takes hold of the wire with both hands --
text: -- and PULLS with all his might. Pushing off with his feet,
text: for leverage, against the Man’s body.
text: The Man’s hands instantly raise to his throat. He writhes
text: and thrashes like a fish on a boat deck. Desperately tries
text: to squeeze his fingers beneath the wire.
text: His face turns color. Red first, then blue. The veins in
text: his forehead and neck look as if they are about to burst.
text: David bares his clenched teeth, holding on with all his
dialog: strength.
text: The Man’s legs kick uncontrollably, more and more...until --
text: -- he succumbs to asphyxiation. He stops moving. His head
text: slowly slumps to his chest.
text: It’s over.
text: Corey inches away from the body. Equally unnerved, David
text: pushes the Man’s dead, bloodied body off of him, onto the
dialog: floor.
text: INSERT - The P.O.V. from the black and white security camera
speaker_heading: in the ATM:
text: David slides out from underneath the Man. Lets go of the
text: signing shelf pen cord, wrapped around the Man’s throat. It
text: slips off the Man. Dangles from the signing shelf.
text: Corey and Emily stare. David looks up at them.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Is he...?
text: Still laboring to catch his breath, David responds with an
text: uneasy nod.
text: Corey lets out a long sigh. His lungs are also on fire from
text: the encounter. He takes off his collared dress shirt,
text: leaving him in a T-shirt. He holds the collared shirt to his
text: bloody nose.
speaker_heading: EMILY (CONT'D)
dialog: What...what do we do now?
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Leave.
text: David nods in agreement, still somewhat shell-shocked.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: We have to tell the police.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah. We will. Let’s just get out
dialog: of here first.
text: David climbs to his feet. Corey does the same.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Emily)
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Yeah. Are you?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I think so.
dialog: (to Corey)
dialog: How's your nose.
text: Corey doesn’t answer. He slowly lowers the shirt from his
text: nose. His dilated eyes stare straight ahead.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Corey)
dialog: Hey...? You all right?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: No...
text: David looks at Emily. She also stares outside. David turns
text: to see what they’re looking at.
dialog: 65.
text: To his shock, he sees the Man. Standing twenty feet from the
text: entrance. Watching them.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What...? How’s he...?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: What did you do?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I didn’t do anything. He...he was
dialog: going to kill us!
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: (re: the dead body)
dialog: Who is he? If it’s not him, then
dialog: who is it?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don’t know. I thought...you did,
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: I know, I know!
text: David is thunderstruck. He places his hand against the wall
text: to steady himself.
text: Emily takes steps away, overcome by emotion.
text: After a beat, Corey takes off the dead man’s parka. Its hood
text: -- which was on the dead man’s head when he first entered the
text: vestibule -- has since fallen off, exposing his bloody face.
text: Underneath the parka, the dead man wears a work uniform of
text: some kind. A factory-style jumpsuit. A plastic employee
text: badge for “NEWGATE HOSPITAL” -- with his photo, name and
scene_heading: “CUSTODIAL DEPT. - 3RD SHIFT” printed on it -- is clipped to
text: his breast pocket.
text: Corey searches through the parka pockets. He only finds
text: useless pieces of paper. He then starts a search of the dead
text: man’s pants pockets.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: COREY
text: Looking for a cell phone.
text: Corey continues his frantic search. From the dead man’s
dialog: pockets, he removes:
dialog: Set of keys...
dialog: 66.
dialog: Small bits of paper...
dialog: And a wallet.
dialog: But no cell phone.
speaker_heading: COREY (CONT'D)
dialog: Nothing.
text: Corey resignedly tosses the items to the cold, tile floor.
text: Emily notices an ATM card lying on the floor.
text: David grabs the dead man’s discarded wallet off the floor.
text: Sifts through its contents:
dialog: A credit card...
dialog: Very little cash...
text: A small photo of him, along with a woman of about the same
dialog: age and two adolescent children...
dialog: His license...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (reading)
dialog: Harold Westbrook. Eight Frederick
dialog: Street. Date of birth: five,
dialog: nineteen, sixty-eight.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What the hell was he doing here?
speaker_heading: EMILY
text: Using the ATM.
text: David looks over to see Emily holding Harold’s ATM card.
text: David leans back against the frosty glass. Sits down. His
text: head falls into his trembling hands.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: We don’t know anything about this
dialog: guy. For all we know, he could've
dialog: been working with that douchebag
dialog: outside.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: He’s got a wife...kids.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: So what? That could all be
dialog: bullshit.
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: For Christ's sake, Corey, the guy’s
dialog: a fucking janitor. He was on his
dialog: way to work.
text: Emily places the ATM card on the floor and moves back.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: He’s innocent...
dialog: (sotto, but loud enough
dialog: for them to hear)
dialog: Just like we are.
text: Corey and David are quickly sobered by this statement. A few
text: moments of silence pass before David breaks it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (re: Harold, dejected)
dialog: Not anymore.
text: David looks at Emily. His guilt is palpable.
text: Corey can’t fight it anymore. He knows they’re right.
text: He kicks over the metal waste basket. Paper flies
dialog: everywhere.
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: The Man watches them for a moment. Studies them.
text: After a beat, he moves into the shadows.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: Emily returns to the opposite side of the vestibule. David
text: remains seated against the glass, his arms huddled to his
text: chest. Corey walks over to Harold’s body and takes the parka
dialog: off him.
text: Seeing Harold’s bloody, dead body makes Emily uneasy. She
text: looks away.
text: Corey puts the heavy parka on over his T-shirt. Walks to the
text: other end of the vestibule. Leans against the glass.
text: It’s apparent they all need some space from one another.
text: No one says a word at first. And then, after a long beat:
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You had to make me stop. You
dialog: couldn't just go home...
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Fuck you, David. Don’t even try
dialog: make this my fault.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It is your fault!
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: The Man walks to the rear of the vestibule.
text: David and Corey continue to argue OFF-SCREEN. Their voices,
text: though slightly silenced by the walls, still carry through
dialog: enough to be heard.
speaker_heading: COREY (0.S.)
dialog: Nobody made you stop.
speaker_heading: DAVID (0.S.)
dialog: You did!
text: The Man flips open the toolbox. Grabs the spool of metal
dialog: wire.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: The argument continues.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: I didn’t make you do anything. You
dialog: could've said no.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I did say no. Twice. But as
dialog: usual, you didn’t give a shit.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: That still doesn’t make this my
dialog: fault. If it’s anyone’s fault,
dialog: it’s yours.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Mine?
text: David leaps to his feet.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Get the fuck out of my face.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Fuck you.
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: (re: Harold )
dialog: You're the one who did this...
text: With that, David immediately charges at Corey.
text: INSERT - The P.O.V. from the silent, black and white camera
dialog: inside the ATM:
text: David slams Corey hard into the plaster wall. Corey stands
text: back, momentarily shocked. He appears to shout something and
text: then charges back at David.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
text: Corey tries to tackle David, but David holds his ground.
text: Emily attempts to break it up.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Stop! Stop it!
text: David pushes Corey back against the wall. Corey responds by
text: SHOVING David hard to his chest.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (to Corey)
dialog: You did it, too!
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Get off me!
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: The Man watches from the shadows, not far from David’s car.
text: Corey and David continue to push and shove each other.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: David and Corey, still tangled up, have clearly begun to
dialog: tire.
text: Their arms soon unlock. Release their grip on each other,
text: breaking the stalemate.
text: They each let out long sighs, which curl from their mouths in
text: spirals of cold mist.
text: They walk away from each other.
text: Emily looks outside.
speaker_heading: EMILY
text: He’s gone again.
dialog: 70.
text: David doesn’t bother to look. Neither does Corey. Their
text: disdainful gazes are locked on each other.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: He’s out there. Somewhere.
text: It’s clear that Corey’s reached a breaking point.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: I'm tired of this shit. I’m tired
text: of hiding. Tired of waiting for
dialog: someone to come save me.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It’s the only option we have.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: You have.
text: Corey grabs his bottle of tequila. Takes a swig.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: What are you going to do?
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Get the hell out of here.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That’s what he wants you to do --
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: -- Fuck him! He’s one guy! There
dialog: are three of us.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I can’t go out there, Corey.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Don't.
dialog: (to David)
dialog: You either.
dialog: (to both)
dialog: I don’t even care anymore. If you
dialog: want to stay in here and die,
dialog: that’s your call. But I’m done
dialog: with this.
text: Corey places his bottle of Tequila on the ground.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Please, just wait...
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: No. No more waiting.
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Enough with the tough guy rou --
text: Wait...what?!! Corey’s BURSTS out of the vestibule door!!
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Corey, no!!
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: Corey stops for a brief moment, not far from the door. Scans
text: the parking lot. To the left...to the right. It’s empty --
text: the Man is nowhere to be found.
text: David and Emily bang against the glass, trying to get Corey
dialog: to return.
text: Corey disregards their pleas.
text: He steels himself -- and then RACES into the darkened lot.
text: His legs pump hard despite being nearly locked up from the
text: cold. His heart drums wildly.
text: Just as he is about to pass by David's car --
text: -- WHAM!! His legs inexplicably come out from under him,
text: landing him flat on his back. Hard. The bone in his left
text: leg BREAKS.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: David and Emily watch. Panicked.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Corey!
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: Corey lies on the ground, in agonizing pain. He coughs,
text: gasps for breath. Holds his throat.
text: Still, he tries to drag himself to safety.
text: Just then, the Man approaches him, arriving from out of the
text: darkness. Traces something in the air -- a straight line of
dialog: some kind.
text: WE SEE what it is he traces: the metal wire -- strung across
text: the clearing between the car and the pole of an overhead
dialog: light.
dialog: 72.
dialog: He created a perimeter.
text: The Man hovers over Corey. Corey’s gaze climbs him, until he
text: finally stares at the Man’s shrouded face. Deep, cloudy
text: breaths emanate from underneath his hood.
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Please...please...
scene_heading: INSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: David bangs against the glass. Pleads for his friend’s life.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No!! Nol!!!
text: The Man looks over at David and Emily. He calmly pulls out a
text: SCREWDRIVER from inside his parka.
text: David's eyes widen as he sees the screwdriver. He tries to
text: exit the vestibule to help his friend, but Emily grabs hold
text: of him. She hangs on with all her might.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: No!! Corey!!!
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: David, no!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Let me go!!
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: It’s too late!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No it’s not! Let me go!
text: David opens the door and pushes free of Emily. Harder than
text: he probably intended. She falls backward, tripping over
text: Harold’s legs and SLAMMING her head onto the cold floor.
text: Seeing this, David stops. Closes the door and rushes to her
dialog: side.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Shit! I’m sorry! Emily...!
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I'm okay. I’m all right.
text: She rubs the back of her head.
dialog: 73.
text: Seeing that she’s okay, David starts to turn away. Emily
text: grabs him by the arm with surprising force, stopping him.
speaker_heading: EMILY (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t look.
text: Emily's fearful pleas give David pause.
dialog: But, David has to look.
text: He slowly turns to face the vestibule door. Outside, he sees
text: Corey's dead, bloody body lying on the cold concrete. The
text: screwdriver still sticking from his stomach.
text: David's hands tremble. His breathing borders on
dialog: hyperventilation.
text: Nearing a breakdown, David's feet move backwards. Slowly.
text: Further and further away from the door.
text: His back soon touches the plaster wall. Collapses onto it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: This can’t...this can’t be
dialog: happening...
text: He rubs at his eyes, his temples. His hands wring his mussed
text: hair. His whole body shakes.
text: He falls apart.
text: Emily waits a moment before approaching him. Sits down next
text: to him. She holds him; he holds her. They shiver in the
text: unyielding cold.
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: The Man walks behind the vestibule. Picks up the hammer and
text: screwdriver. He's just about to SMASH the metal door, when
text: he’s distracted by a distant sound.
text: Turning to see what caused it, he notices that yet another
text: Christmas tree has blown over near the supermarket. It pulls
text: against a metal chain, which keeps it from completely blowing
dialog: away.
text: He is about to return his attention to the vestibule, but
text: does a double-take when he sees --
text: -- the long, frozen, industrial hose snaked between the rows
dialog: of Christmas trees.
dialog: 74.
text: He takes a beat. The vapor of misty breath stops coming from
text: under his parka hood. The world seems still, quiet. As if
text: providing him with the silence he needs to think.
text: Then, a sudden release of breath escapes his mouth as he
text: marches over to the row of Christmas trees.
text: He grabs the industrial hose. Pulls. It cracks and creaks
text: as the ice inside and around it breaks up.
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
scene_heading: INSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: David and Emily huddle close together for warmth. It does
dialog: little to keep their bodies from freezing.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: The hat...I knew it wasn’t yours.
dialog: I grabbed it off the back of
text: someone’s chair.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (shrugs )
dialog: I was desperate.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: For a way to keep you from leaving.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I wish I had just let you go. I’m
dialog: so sorry.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Don’t be.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You should be home right now.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: David...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It’s my fault.
text: An unsettling realization occurs to Emily.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: You're right. It is.
dialog: 75.
text: David looks at Emily. Surprised by her concurrence.
speaker_heading: EMILY (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s all of our fault.
text: Emily sets adrift in thought.
speaker_heading: EMILY (CONT'D)
dialog: We've been in here for hours now
dialog: trying to control what’s happening
dialog: to us. Waiting for...a reason.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What, because we didn’t do anything
dialog: wrong we’re somehow supposed to be
dialog: protected? By who? The police?
text: Alarms? Little visor clips with
dialog: angels on them?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: If there is a reason this is
dialog: happening, it’s because we never
dialog: thought it could.
text: David takes a moment to consider this.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Still, you shouldn't be here.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I could have taken a cab. I could
dialog: have skipped the party. I could
dialog: have never worked at Starkweather
dialog: in the first place. But, I did all
dialog: those things, and a million, random
dialog: things in between, and added up
dialog: they all brought me here
dialog: tonight...with you.
text: David looks up at Emily.
speaker_heading: EMILY (CONT'D)
dialog: Although, given what’s happened,
dialog: lunch would have probably been a
dialog: better choice.
text: David ekes out a smile. He pulls Emily closer. They tighten
text: their embrace.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’ve wanted to be this close to you
dialog: for so long.
text: Emily's head falls to David’s chest, against his T-shirt.
text: Her chin slowly rises.
dialog: 76.
text: Tears trickle over her lips as they draw nearer to David's.
dialog: And then, suddenly --
dialog: BANG! !
text: David and Emily LEAP to their feet. Turn to face the plaster
dialog: wall.
scene_heading: BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG! !
text: Followed by silence.
text: David and Emily stare at the plaster wall. Like deer in
text: headlights. Waiting for whatever could possibly happen next.
text: And then, the distinct sound of old, rusted hinges squealing
text: as a hulking metal door is forced open.
text: David and Emily listen intently.
scene_heading: DUN.....--- DUN.......- DUN......--
text: The Man’s heavy footsteps trace along the opposite side of
text: the plaster wall.
text: A faint clinking sound is heard, coming from the heating
text: vent. Metal touching metal. But just as suddenly as it
text: started, it stops.
text: Silence. Emily and David don’t move a muscle. They wait.
text: David's attention is suddenly stolen by something he sees out
text: of the corner of his eye.
text: David turns around fully to get a better look.
text: His visage of bewilderment is instantly replaced by that of
dialog: shock.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Christ...
text: Emily turns to see what David is looking at.
text: It’s Corey. He’s ash-white. Bleeding profusely. The
text: screwdriver still stuck in his stomach.
text: Corey's quivering arms drag himself across the parking lot,
text: toward the ATM vestibule. A trail of smeared blood follows
dialog: him.
text: Emily is about to say something -- or scream -- when David
text: pulls her close to him. Covers her mouth.
dialog: 77.
text: Puts a finger to his mouth. Shhhhhhhh. A cloud of smoke
text: accentuates his silent directive.
text: He points at the plaster wall, referring to the Man. Emily
text: gets it -- she nods.
text: David removes his hand from her mouth.
text: David quietly opens the vestibule door. Exits. Emily exits
dialog: with him to...
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: They are instantly hit with an achingly cold gust of wind.
text: In the background, WE SEE the time and temperature sign.
dialog: Current time: 3:léam. Temperature: negative 6 degrees
dialog: Fahrenheit.
text: David and Emily sneak across the parking lot. Hurry over to
text: Corey. Grab him under the arms. Lift the upper part of his
text: body off the ground.
text: For a moment they consider whether to make a run for it in
text: the other direction. But it’s impossible. They have to get
text: Corey back inside.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (hushed)
dialog: Okay. Come on.
text: They move Corey back toward the vestibule, trying not to make
text: a sound. His rag doll legs noisily drag across the ground.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: (hushed)
dialog: Hurry...
text: They continue to drag Corey. Blood spills from his open
dialog: wound. They’re halfway there, when --
speaker_heading: THE MAN
text: appears from out of the shadows. He moves toward them.
text: Faster than usual.
speaker_heading: DAVID AND EMILY
text: see the Man. They panic.

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Go-go-go!!
text: They pull with all their might, as fast as their frozen,
dialog: fatigued bodies will allow.
speaker_heading: THE MAN
text: closes the distance between them. He holds the tire iron in
text: his hand.
speaker_heading: DAVID AND EMILY
text: pull Corey with all their collective might. David’s legs get
text: tangled with Corey’s. He stumbles.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Get up! He’s coming!!
text: David quickly gets back to his feet. They resume their
dialog: rescue effort.
speaker_heading: THE MAN
text: gets dangerously close. Within twenty feet. Fifteen feet.
dialog: Ten feet...
speaker_heading: DAVID AND EMILY
dialog: call upon every last bit of strength they possess.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Get the door!! I’ve got him -- get
dialog: the door!!
speaker_heading: EMILY
text: lets go of Corey. Rushes over to the vestibule.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: grabs Corey under both arms from behind. Lifts him a bit
text: higher off the ground than he previously had been. Corey
text: lets out a pained groan.
speaker_heading: THE MAN
text: sees Emily rushing for the vestibule. He chooses to stay on
text: David. He’s close. Very close.
speaker_heading: EMILY
text: opens the door. Rushes inside. Holds the door open with an
text: outstretched arm.
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: THE MAN
text: raises the tire iron as he gets within striking distance of
dialog: David.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: David! Hurry!!
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: gives Corey one final, desperate pull, dragging him...
scene_heading: INSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: Emily helps pull David in, as he still carries Corey. Emily
text: SLAMS the door shut.
text: INSERT - The P.O.V. from the black and white security camera
speaker_heading: in the ATM:
text: David falls into the vestibule, on top of Corey, after
text: dragging his body in there.
text: David drags and leans Corey against one of the windows.
text: David's body blocks much of what is going on with Corey.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: The Man stands outside the vestibule. Just over ten feet
text: away from the entrance. Still holding the tire iron.
text: He stares at Emily, who remains standing at the door.
text: Transfixed. After a beat, the Man lowers the tire iron to
dialog: his side.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: Emily stares back at the Man. Terrified.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Emily, what are you doing?! I need
dialog: your help!
text: Emily snaps out of it. Slowly. Still staring at the Man.
text: After a beat, she joins David, who attends to Corey.
text: Corey’s in worse condition than it seemed.
text: His skin is terribly pale.
text: His purple lips tremble.
dialog: 80.
text: Blood leaks from his stomach, through his flimsy T-shirt and
text: all over Harold's parka, which he still wears.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (to Corey)
dialog: Holy shit, holy shit. Corey?
dialog: Corey? Can you hear me? Come on,
dialog: buddy...please...Corey? Corey?!
dialog: (to Emily)
dialog: We've got to get him help.
speaker_heading: EMILY
text: Cover his stomach with something.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: With what?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Anything!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don’t have -- give me something!
text: Emily looks around. Grabs a handful of deposit envelopes.
dialog: Hands them to David.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: (re: the envelopes)
dialog: Use these.
text: David places them against Corey’s wound, carefully avoiding
text: the screwdriver. Blood immediately soaks through the paper.
text: The pressure causes Corey to emit an anguished scream. He
dialog: doubles over.
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: The Man leans in the smashed passenger side window of David’s
text: car. Shifts it into NEUTRAL.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: Corey’s condition worsens by the second.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What do I do?!
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I don’t know!
text: Corey shivers uncontrollably. He’s freezing. Bleeding to
dialog: death.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Jesus...Corey....
dialog: To Emily, regarding the screwdriver:
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Should I pull it out?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: No. It could make it worse.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (re: the blood)
dialog: It’s not stopping!
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I know, I know...
text: Emily places Corey’s discarded button-down shirt -- which he
text: previously left in the vestibule after using it to blot his
text: bloody nose -- over his stomach.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Do it easy.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I have to put pressure on it!
text: Emily presses the shirt down on Corey’s wound, trying to
text: stabilize his bleeding. More blood oozes out. Corey
text: responds weakly. It’s clear he’s fading fast.
text: The blood soaks through the shirt, drenching it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We've got to get him to a hospital.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don’t know, but we have to. He’s
dialog: going to bleed to death if we
dialog: don’t.
text: Corey continues to shiver.
text: Emily takes off her coat, leaving her in her work blouse.
text: She drapes it over Corey like a blanket.
text: Still aiding Corey, David looks outside for the Man.
text: nowhere in sight.
dialog: 82.
text: David turns his attention back inside the vestibule.
text: Frantically looks everywhere for an answer.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: If we try to...
text: David notices that Corey is starting to drift away. He
text: gently taps his cheek to bring him back.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Corey)
dialog: ...whoa-whoa-whoa, Corey...Corey!
text: Corey comes back around, albeit slightly.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: (re: the compress)
dialog: Keep holding that there.
text: David climbs to his feet. Nervously searches the vestibule.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: What are you doing?
text: David picks up the metal waste basket. Takes firm hold of
dialog: it.
dialog: Without even a moment of hesitation --
text: WHACK! WHACK! WHACK! David slams the waste basket against
dialog: the ATM.
text: INSERT - P.O.V. from the black and white security camera in
speaker_heading: the ATM:
text: The round base of the metal waste basket comes into frame as
text: it’s continuously SMASHED against the ATM.
text: After yet another SMASH with the waste basket, the image on
text: ATM security camera goes dead.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
text: The ATM display screen is shattered. There is no longer an
text: image -- only a dead, broken monitor.
text: David looks up to the emergency lights with hope in his
text: expectant eyes.
text: Still, no alarm.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: What are you doing?!
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It’ll send a signal to the police,
dialog: won't it? If the ATM’s broken?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I don’t know!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, something in this thing has
dialog: to! It’s owned by a God damn bank!
text: Still tending to the rapidly fading Corey, Emily glances
text: outside. Her mouth falls agape.
text: David turns and sees why.
text: The Man has rolled David’s car up against the front of the
text: vestibule. The front bumper presses against the glass door.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: What...?
text: David tries to open the vestibule door. Not a chance. He
text: frantically tries again. It barely opens an inch.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: We're locked in.
text: Corey suddenly starts to convulse.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: (re: Corey)
dialog: What’s he doing?!
text: David rushes over to help. Grabs Corey’s shaking legs.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Grab him!
text: Emily struggles to Keep Corey’s body under control. Blood
text: and bile spill from the corner of his mouth.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Corey! Come on, buddy. Please...
text: Corey soon stops. He’s alive. Barely. His blood soaks
text: David's clothes.
text: David is paralyzed by his inability to do a damn thing to fix
dialog: the situation.
text: And then -- THERE'S WATER.
text: It rushes through the heating vent. Fast.
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Holy shit!
text: The icy water rapidly spreads across the floor. Pools in the
dialog: corners.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Stop it!
text: David stuffs Corey’s discarded, bloody shirt into the metal
text: grate covering the vent. It does little to stop the heavy
dialog: flow of water.
text: He winces in pain as the cold water stings his shivering,
text: purple hands. The water splashes all over him, soaking his
dialog: clothes.
text: An inch of water has already filled the vestibule. Some
text: leaks out from underneath the door and windows -- but not
dialog: much.
speaker_heading: EMILY (CONT'D)
dialog: David, help me!
text: Emily tries to lift Corey’s body from the water.
text: David rushes over to help. They lift Corey’s body. He emits
text: a pained moan.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: The signing shelf.
text: Their feet splash through the frigid water as they struggle
text: to carry Cory’s limp body over to the signing shelf.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: On three. One, two, three...
text: They try to lift Corey high enough to lay him on the signing
dialog: shelf, but can’t.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Higher!
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I...I...can’t.
text: Emily's bent fingers appear almost arthritic. The cold and
text: wet is crippling. She shivers uncontrollably.
text: David grabs Corey by himself. Lifts him. Places him on the
text: shelf -- but it’s far too narrow. Corey slips right off.
dialog: 85.
text: David has no choice but to place him back on the ground, in
text: the water. It’s now close to six inches deep.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Fuck...
text: Emily drapes her coat over Corey once again. David
text: approaches the door.
text: He tries to control his erratic, irrepressibly rapid
text: breathing. His purple lips quiver.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: (re: the Man)
dialog: He’s trying to drown us.
text: David pushes the door with all his might.
text: It opens an inch. Water drains -- but cold air rushes in.
text: David's muscles give. The door closes.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Not drown us -- freeze us.
text: The water is unremitting. Gallon after ice cold gallon
text: spills from out of the vent, bringing the level in the
text: vestibule just under David and Emily’s knees.
text: Harold's corpse floats at the surface of the frigid water.
text: Holding Corey close, compressing his wound, David’s eyes
text: frenetically dart in every direction, searching for a
dialog: solution.
text: And then, he sees something -- right in front of his face.
text: The focus of his rapt attention: a pack of cigarettes, poking
text: out of the inside pocket of Harold’s parka -- which is still
text: being worn by Corey.
text: David ferrets through the parka. Removes the pack of
text: cigarettes. As he clearly hoped, a disposable lighter is
text: also tucked away in the inside pocket.
text: His look of hopelessness evaporates from his face, overcome
text: by an expression of nascent optimism.
text: He then looks up at the ceiling, where he sees --
text: -- the FIRE SPRINKLER system, poking through various parts of
text: the high ceiling.
text: David hatches an instant plan. Potentially a good one.
dialog: 86.
text: He leaps to his feet. Climbs, with great difficulty, on top
text: of the metal signing shelf. Tries sparking the lighter. His
text: numb, purple hands lack the motor skills required to spin the
dialog: striker.
text: He resolves to use the palm of his other hand to spin it.
text: It only spits a few sparks.
text: One more try. Finally, it catches. He holds the lighter
text: over his head. But, the ceiling is far too high.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: shit!
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: You need to be higher.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I know, I know...
text: Emily sits Corey up against the wall. She then collects as
text: many paper items as she can that have not yet gotten wet.
text: Deposit envelopes, discarded receipts, etc.
text: Stuffs them in the metal waste basket, which now floats on
text: the surface of the rising water.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Find as much paper as you can.
dialog: Anything that will burn.
text: David joins Emily as they both work intensively at this task.
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: The Man sets up the folding lawn chair. Sits in it. Watches
text: David and Emily from afar as they race to fill the waste
dialog: basket.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: The waste basket is fairly full.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That’s enough.
text: David holds out the lighter. Again he struggles to light it.
dialog: Spark. Spark.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: Come on, come on...
dialog: 87.
dialog: Spark. Spark.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on!
dialog: And then, finally --
text: -- and it catches. He uses his other hand to shield the
text: flame as he moves the lighter closer to the paper in the
dialog: waste basket.
text: David touches the flame to the corner of a single piece of
text: paper. The flames quickly spread. He stuffs the lighter
text: into his pants pocket.
text: Within a matter of seconds, large flames jump out from the
text: top of the waste basket.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: All right -- hold onto it.
text: Emily takes hold of the waste basket. Watches David as the
text: ice cold water continues to rise.
text: He places his knee on top of the signing shelf. Reaches to
text: grab hold of anything that can assist him in his climb -- but
text: there’s nothing. Just a blank, glass wall.
text: Inching forward onto his butt, he manages to sit on the
text: narrow shelf. The next step is far more difficult: standing
dialog: up.
text: He checks the status of the fire inside the waste basket.
text: Still burning, but already showing signs of weakening. He
text: looks over at Corey, who sits against the wall. The water is
text: up to his chest.
text: Time is running out -- for everyone.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Throw in more paper.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: There’s only a little left!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Use it!
text: Emily throws in the last of the paper. The fire reignites to
dialog: its original strength.
text: She approaches the signing shelf.
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Here -- grab onto my shoulders.
text: David does just that. He’s able to maintain his balance long
dialog: enough to stand up.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Okay...hand it to me.
text: Ducking away from the flames, Emily lifts up the metal waste
dialog: basket.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Careful...be careful.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Take it...take it!
text: David takes the waste basket.
text: Emily takes several steps backward. Sloshes through the ice
dialog: cold water.
text: David lifts the waste basket. Past his face. Over his head.
text: His lower back inches away from the wall. He sways back and
dialog: forth.
text: His view of the fire sprinkler is blocked by the waste
dialog: basket.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Am I near it?
text: She shakes her head to offer a distressed “No.”
text: David angles the waste basket so he can see for himself.
text: He’s not even close. The ceiling is simply too high.
text: He lets out a frustrated scream. Lowers the waste basket.
text: Rests it on the signing shelf.
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: David's scream is dampened by the glass windows.
text: The Man remains seated in the lawn chair. Patiently waiting.
text: He watches as Emily pushes against the door. It opens enough
dialog: to let some water out.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE VESTIBULE
dialog: 89.
text: The fire inside the waste basket is dying fast.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We need more paper. Anything!
text: Corey fades in and out of consciousness. His skin has turned
text: an icy blue.
text: The water level is up to his chin. Emily’s jacket, which was
text: previously draped over him like a blanket, now floats on top
text: of the water, as does his capped bottle of tequila.
text: Emily tears cardboard Bank of the Midwest advertisements out
text: from behind their plastic shields, on the plaster wall.
text: Hurries them over to David.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Throw these in.
dialog: David does just that.
text: WOOSH -- the advertisements go up in flames. David angles
text: away from the heat. But the flames quickly subside.
text: Threaten to extinguish.
text: Emily and David’s already raised panic increases.
speaker_heading: EMILY (CONT'D)
dialog: Help me up.
text: Emily starts climbing onto the signing table. She extends
text: her hand for David to grab.
speaker_heading: EMILY (CONT'D)
dialog: Help pull me up.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No -- what are you doing?
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: The fire’s going to burn out.
text: David helps Emily onto the narrow signing shelf. The two of
text: them barely fit on top of it. The flaming waste basket
dialog: doesn’t make it any easier.
text: Emily takes hold of David's shoulder as she gets her balance.
text: Being smaller than David, she has less trouble standing up.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What the hell are you --
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Try to squat down a little.
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: The fire’s going out. We’re
dialog: wasting time!
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: If I can get on your shoulders, I
dialog: should be able to get close enough
text: to the sprinklers.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Just do it, David! Please!
text: David squats down. Slightly. His back eases away from the
text: wall. His balance is shaky.
text: Emily places her foot on David's thigh. Carefully grabs
text: around his neck. Tries to climb on top of him.
text: With one hand still balancing the waste basket on the signing
text: table, David uses the other to help Emily climb.
text: Emily's foot slips off David’s thigh. She loses her balance,
text: but manages to stay on the signing shelf.
text: Corey emits a pained moan, which instantly turns into a misty
text: spiral in the cold air.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Forget it!
text: David grabs the other side of the waste basket. Ready to
dialog: lift it again.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Help me up again.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Forget it, Emily. It’s not
dialog: working!
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: You can’t reach it by yourself!
text: David reluctantly gives in. He squats lower, struggling to
dialog: maintain his balance.
speaker_heading: EMILY (CONT'D)
dialog: Lower...
dialog: gl.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I can’t get any lower without
dialog: falling off.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Try!
text: He manages to lower himself a few more inches. His legs sway
text: back and forth, threatening to cause him to fall at any
dialog: moment.
text: Emily again places her foot on David’s thigh...
text: Grabs hold around his neck...
text: Pulls herself up...
text: Slowly raises her leg over his shoulder, followed by the
dialog: other.
text: She’s on.
text: David wavers a bit, causing Emily to sway, but he manages to
text: hold fast. He slowly presses up with his legs.
dialog: They did it. And not a minute too soon -- the fire is
text: rapidly fading.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Okay, pass it to me.
text: David grips the waste basket.
text: His knees shake a bit. His balance remains unsteady. He
text: raises the flaming waste basket.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Okay, take it.
text: The flames get rather close to Emily. Still, she reaches for
dialog: the waste basket.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: Almost...
text: David extends his arms above his head as far as he can.
text: Emily's hands lunge for the basket. She reaches further...
dialog: Further...
dialog: And then finally --
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: EMILY (CONT'D)
dialog: I've got it!
text: David slowly releases the waste basket. Emily holds onto it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: All right, rise it above you.
text: Under one of the sprinklers.
text: Emily spots the closest sprinkler. It’s right above her.
text: The top of David's feet dangle precariously off the edge of
text: the shelf. His hypothermic body sways back and forth.
text: Emily's skinny, soaking wet arms struggle to raise the metal
text: waste basket over her head.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Higher!
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: I'm trying!!
text: It inches up further. Almost close enough.
dialog: Higher...
dialog: Higher...
dialog: Almost there...
text: And then, as the flames lick against the sprinkler --
text: -- PSSSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!! All of the sprinklers fire,
text: raining down water inside the vestibule.
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: The Man watches from the shadows as a STROBE LIGHT flashes
text: repeatedly from inside the vestibule. A separate strobe
text: light flashes outside the vestibule.
text: An audible ALARM sounds: WOOP...WOOP...WOOP...WOOP...
scene_heading: INSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: Frigid water sprays all over Emily and David. The strobe
text: light flashes ad nauseam. The alarm is deafening.
text: But Emily and David rejoice.
speaker_heading: EMILY
dialog: It worked! It wor --
dialog: 93.
text: The signing shelf gives on one side. Collapses.
text: David's legs come right out from under him. He and Emily
dialog: come CRASHING down.
text: David SPLASHES into the waist-deep water that fills the
text: vestibule. His back SLAMS against the floor below with a
dialog: thud.
text: Emily, falling from an even greater height, falls straight
dialog: down --
text: -- SMACK!! Her head SMASHES against the half of the signing
text: shelf that did not collapse. She SPLASHES into the water.
text: Clouds of crimson spill from her head, clouding the water in
text: which she now floats.
text: In a great deal of pain, hypothermic, David emerges from the
text: water. Sees Emily lying motionless in the sanguine water.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Emily!!
text: He rushes through the water to her. Lifts her in his arms.
text: Holds her close to him. Shivers uncontrollably.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: (frantic)
dialog: Oh my God. Emily!
text: She barely stirs. Her eyes flutter. Bloody spit spills from
text: the corner of her mouth.
text: She's alive. Hanging on by a thread.
text: Gelid water also continues to rain down from the sprinkler,
text: causing the water level to rise twice as fast as before.
text: The strobe light keeps its cadence, as does the audible alarm
dialog: sound.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: Please...just hold on. Help’s on
dialog: the way. Hold on.
text: Emily's almost completely unresponsive. She starts to slip
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: No-no-no...come back, come back.
dialog: 94.
text: Emily comes around, albeit ever so slightly. But only for a
text: moment. She and David look in each other’s eyes...and
dialog: then...
dialog: ...she’s gone.
text: Crestfallen, David leans his head against the glass wall,
text: hugging Emily close to him. He shivers madly, colder than
dialog: ever.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No...
text: The ear-piercing sound of the alarm and the extremely bright
text: strobe light are maddening.
text: Holding Emily in his trembling arms, covered in her blood, he
text: rapidly comes undone.
text: He looks across the vestibule, at Corey, who, like Harold,
text: floats face-down on the surface of the water.
text: Time has expired for him as well.
text: David falls apart. The water from the sprinklers rains down
text: on his defeated head.
text: It’s over.
dialog: But then --
dialog: -- SMASH!!!!!
text: David's car CRASHES through the vestibule door, after having
text: been RAMMED by the Security Car.
text: The vestibule’s glass walls SHATTER.
text: Water RUSHES from the vestibule, into the parking lot,
text: bringing Corey’s body with it.
text: David lays on the floor of what remains of the vestibule.
text: Injured. Disoriented. Bleeding. Freezing.
text: He soon regains his faculties. Looks at the piled-up cars.
text: The destruction. The bodies.
text: He crawls over to where Emily’s body now lay. Cradles her in
text: his tremulous arms.
text: A single tear streaks down his pallid cheek. It clings to
text: his clenched jaw before falling to the ground.
dialog: 95.
text: He looks outside the vestibule at the Man, who is back in
text: view, seated -- to David’s confusion -- in the folding lawn
dialog: chair.
text: The Man doesn’t flinch. He just sits and watches.
text: But then -- a change in David begins to occur. Angry tears
text: escape his eyes. His teeth clench. His pulse races. His
text: breathing becomes fast and guttural.
text: Overcome by a blinding rage, he leans Emily’s lifeless body
text: against the wall. Sits her upright, against the badly
text: damaged plaster wall.
text: He tenderly brushes her hair from her pretty face as the
text: achingly cold water continues to spray from the fire
text: sprinklers above.
text: Despite the extensive damage suffered by the vestibule, the
text: emergency lights continue to strobe, interspersing flashes of
text: white light with moments of almost complete darkness...
text: The fire alarm keeps its maddening cadence.
text: David climbs to his feet. Walks, like a caged animal, across
text: the vestibule. His eyes lock on Corey’s half-full bottle of
text: tequila.
text: He unscrews the cap...
text: Reaches into his car through the smashed window. Removes his
text: jacket. Tears out the liner...
text: Pours a small amount of the tequila onto the jacket liner...
text: Stuffs it into the bottle, letting a portion hang outside to
dialog: serve as a wick.
text: A Molotov Cocktail.
text: David then exits what’s left of the vestibule. Walks past
text: the crashed security car. Sees that the gas peddle is wedged
text: to the floor with the tire iron.
text: He approaches Corey’s drenched, dead body.
text: He grabs hold of the screwdriver in Corey’s stomach, looks
text: away -- and YANKS it out.
text: Seething, David again looks out at the Man, who still remains
text: seated in the folding chair, partially shrouded by darkness.
text: David takes one last look at Emily. She leans against the
text: plaster wall, where he left her.
dialog: 96.
text: Tragically beautiful.
text: This galvanizing image brings David to his breaking point.
text: The temperature is crippling. His drenched clothes cling to
text: his enfeebled frame. Still, David soldiers on.
text: He holds the Molotov Cocktail at the ready. The screwdriver
dialog: in the other hand.
text: He removes the lighter from his pocket. It lights on the
text: first try. He touches the flame to the alcohol-soaked jacket
dialog: liner.
dialog: It catches.
text: Covered in blood, and with a look of unbridled hostility on
text: his face, David looks every bit the animal his captivity has
dialog: caused him to become.
text: The alarm sounds loudly...
text: The strobe light continues to flash, outside and inside the
dialog: vestibule...
text: The green security lights spin atop the security car as steam
text: emanates from under its damaged hood...
text: The night’s madness has reached its crescendo..
text: David moves in closer, the screwdriver outstretched before
text: him. Every step he takes gathers more purpose.
text: Incredibly, the Man still does not move from the chair. He
text: sits, hidden in the shadows, watching as David draws nearer.
text: David is now approaching with considerable speed. Without
text: breaking his stride, he takes a quick look at the Molotov
text: Cocktail. It’s more than ready.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (reaching his arm back)
dialog: Burn, you son of a bitch.
text: With that, David throws the bottle down hard from less than
text: ten feet away.
text: -- BOOOOSH!! It crashes directly in front of the Man,
text: instantly engulfing him in flames.
text: A somewhat sadistic, satisfied smile grin crosses David's
dialog: face.
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: BURN! !
text: But then, his savage elation slowly fades away, replaced by a
text: look of grave concern.
text: To David's amazement -- and horror -- the Man doesn't move an
text: inch, despite being burned alive. The flames burn high into
text: the dark sky, but the Man sits motionless.
text: His primal courage quashed, David’s overcome by the crushing
text: return of his fear. He clearly can’t believe what he’s
text: witnessing.
text: He moves in closer to investigate. Cautiously. Shields his
text: face from the heat with his hand.
text: And then, once he’s within a few feet of the Man, something
text: stops David in his tracks. Through the flames, he sees --
text: -- a badge. And a garrison belt. It’s not the Man; it’s the
text: Security Guard. He’s been placed in the chair.
text: David WHIPS his head to where the Security Guard last was.
text: He’s not there. An empty pool of blood on the concrete marks
dialog: his absence.
text: Realizing he’s been tricked, David SPINS around.
text: A look of abject terror appears on his face.
text: WE SEE why. The Man stands outside the vestibule, staring at
text: David, blocking any chance of escape in that direction.
text: With little hesitation, he walks toward David.
text: Upon turning to face the other direction, David sees he
text: finally has a chance to make a run for it.
text: INSERT - The Security Guard’s garrison belt. Covered in
text: fire, the can of pepper spray deforms from the blistering
dialog: heat.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
text: Just as David takes his first step in that direction,
dialog: preparing to dash to safety --
text: -- POP!! The pressurized can of pepper spray BURSTS.
text: A mist BLASTS out from the Security Guard, covering David
text: like a swarm of bees. He falls his knees, clutching at his
text: burning eyes in agony. Screaming. Writhing.
dialog: 98.
text: The Man halts his stride and watches David. Unflinchingly.
text: David tries desperately to see, but cannot. He falls to his
text: knees, at the foot of the burning Security Guard. The
text: screwdriver still in his hand.
text: Suddenly, sirens are heard, getting louder by the second.
text: The faint hue of flashing red and blue lights appear.
text: Within seconds, several POLICE CARS come SCREAMING into the
text: distant entrance of the parking lot, followed by a FIRE
speaker_heading: TRUCK.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE CAR —- CONTINUOUS
text: Through his windshield, a SERGEANT sees the burning Security
text: Guard, as well as David -- who is covered in blood, holding
text: the screwdriver, and screaming like a madman.
text: The strobe lights inside and outside the vestibule continue
text: to flash. Two cars are crashed into the vestibule. Robert’s
text: dead body remains splayed out on the concrete.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: What the hell...?
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS
text: The POLICE CARS speed toward this carnival of chaos.
text: From his vantage point, now further back toward the
text: vestibule, the Man notices the arriving phalanx of POLICE
text: CARS. For a moment he edges forward, considering whether to
text: complete his attack. Instead, restraining himself, he calmly
text: slips into the shadows.
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE VESTIBULE
text: The POLICE CARS come to a SCREECHING halt. The Sergeant
text: SWINGS open his door. Stands behind it. Trains his weapon
dialog: on David.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT (CONT'D)
dialog: Get on the ground!!
text: A PATROLMAN pulls out a SHOTGUN. Points it David.
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
dialog: Drop the weapon!!
text: Still in tremendous pain and unable to see, David is non-
text: compliant. He also has some difficulty hearing the Officers
text: over the glaring sound of the alarm and roaring wind.
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No...what? I don’t...!
text: SCHK-SCHK. The Patrolman cocks the SHOTGUN.
speaker_heading: PATROLMAN
dialog: I said drop it!!
text: David drops the screwdriver, though his wild, uncontrollable
text: movement still appears threatening.
text: Other POLICE OFFICERS pull out their weapons and train them
text: on David. They all tactically inch their way closer to him.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: Get on the God damn ground!! NOW!!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Help me...he’s still here!!
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: (to another Officer)
dialog: Move in! Move in!!
text: Two other Police Officers RUSH David. SMASH him down to the
text: ground. Drop a knee into his back. Grab at his arms.
text: David struggles. Resists.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: He’s right there!! He’s --
text: David's cut short by the weight of an Officer’s baton against
text: the back of his neck. He yells out in pain.
text: Laying prostrate on the ground, David's wrists are
text: handcuffed.
text: The Firefighters move in fast. Attend to the burning
dialog: Security Guard.
text: With the Officers still pinning him face-first on the ground,
text: David lifts his head from the concrete. Looks toward the
text: vestibule.
text: The Man is gone.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: No! NO!!
text: After a beat, the Sergeant looks over at the vestibule. He
text: does a double-take after catching a glimpse of Emily’s body --
text: as well as Corey and Harold's.
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: We've got three more vics near the
dialog: vestibule. Secure that area!
text: Officers run off toward the vestibule, their guns drawn.
text: David is YANKED to his feet and DRAGGED to a squad car. He
text: fights back.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What are you doing?! No! Wait --
text: The officers grip tight on David’s arms. Their hands feel
text: like vices against his frozen skin. The Officer SHOVES him
text: into the backseat of the squad car.
text: SLAM! He’s locked inside.
text: David's head slumps against the window of the police car.
text: His eyes burning red, his breath stolen from the blow from
text: the baton, all he can do is watch.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
speaker_heading: MONTAGE
text: -- A Fire Official turns off the sprinklers and fire alarm as
text: EMTs lift Emily’s body from the vestibule.
text: -- Police examine the scene, noting the broken security
text: camera and display screen on the ATM.
dialog: -- Detectives and Crime Scene Analysts photograph and diagram
text: the scene, including Corey’s body.
text: -- A Detective opens the trunk to David’s car. Finds
text: Robert's wallet, as well as the deposit envelope filled with
text: cash and Corey’s watch. He also finds Emily’s cell phone,
text: with 911 dialed and ready to be Sent.
text: -- A Detective holds the spool of wire from David’s tool kit
text: as he examines the wire perimeter.
text: -- A Detective picks up the SCREWDRIVER with a pair of latex
text: gloves and places it into an evidence bag.
text: -- Several dead bodies, now covered in white sheets, are
text: wheeled on gurneys into the back of ambulances.
text: -- Detectives review the black and white footage from the
text: security camera located inside the ATM. In it, they see:
text: David and Corey kicking the windows and the plaster wall,
text: looking as though they’re attempting to break into the ATM...
dialog: 101.
text: David slamming Corey against the wall and the wrestling match
dialog: that follows...
text: David attacking and ultimately strangling Harold with the
text: wire attached to the signing shelf pen...
text: David shoving Emily, landing her hard against the floor...
text: David laying next to Corey, covered in blood. He moves away
text: and reveals that Corey has a screwdriver sticking from his
text: stomach. From the camera’s vantage point it appears as
dialog: though David stabbed him...
text: And David smashing the ATM with the base of the metal waste
text: basket until the security camera finally goes to static.
dialog: But nowhere do they ever see the Man. Not in a single,
text: solitary frame of the security camera video. Because he
text: never came within ten feet of the vestibule, he remained
text: outside the camera’s line of sight.
dialog: 
text: It’s as if he was never there.
text: Furthermore, the water flooding the vestibule, Emily’s fall,
text: and the subsequent action, all came after David smashed in
text: the camera, leaving no explanation for how it happened.
text: One of the Detectives presses a button on the video playback.
text: It instantly brings the security camera footage back to an
text: earlier position -- showing a close-up of David's face as he
text: takes money out of his account using the ATM.
text: The close-up image of David’s face remains paused on the
text: video playback screen like a mugshot.
speaker_heading: END MONTAGE
text: The Detectives look at each other. One of them holds David’s
text: swallowed ATM card. His name right on it: “DAVID HARGROVE.”

scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - LATER
text: An early morning sun peeks over the horizon. Police tape
text: cordons off the crime scene.
text: The area is filled with Police and Fire officials. Emergency
text: lights flash. Walkie-talkies crackle.
text: David remains seated in the back of the police car. The
text: Sergeant taps on the back of the squad car. Signals the
text: Patrolman inside.
dialog: 102.
text: With that, the Patrolman starts the car. Turns on red and
text: blues. Lets the siren blare.
text: Officers pull back two wooden police barricades, allowing the
text: police car's egress.
text: The police car cruises through the parting throng of
text: onlookers and news reporters who have since gathered.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE CAR —- CONTINUOUS
text: Physically exhausted and emotionally bankrupt, David’s head
text: falls to his chest.
text: He languidly looks out the car window. Mixed amongst the
text: crowd are several people wearing thick dark parkas, similar
text: to the one the Man wore. David's eyes scan to see if the man
dialog: is among them.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS
text: From within the crowd we watch the police car as it passes
dialog: by.
text: David turns and looks out the rear window as the police car
text: heads further and further down the street.
text: Until it’s gone.
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
scene_heading: INT. LOCKERROOM - MORNING
text: P.O.V. - A man’s outstretched arm hangs a THICK PARKA (the
text: same one the Man wore) up inside a locker. His other arm
text: reaches in and grabs an apron. He places the apron over his
text: head and closes the locker door, revealing the reflection of -
text: - THE MAN (stocky, cropped haircut, average looking).
text: END P.O.V. The man runs his hands over his 5 o’clock shadow
text: before walking off.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. COFFEE SHOP - MOMENTS LATER
text: The man stands behind the counter. We push in, revealing the
